-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Dear all,

I went through RFC7230 [0] over the last days and found some hooks
that might be interesting. This is by no means a full analysis, but I
hope it can form an input for the discussion.

A thought that stuck with me after reading the first chapter of Laura
Denardis' book Protocol Politics is the feature of IP which she calls
'disinterestness', but we can also find this in RFC1958 which says
that the intelligence of the network is found in the endpoints, rather
than in the network. The network is there to transport datagrams
(packets), nothing more, nothing less.
This is relevant for our research because it helps us to look at both
what is organized in protocols, but maybe even more, in what is not
regulated or standardize which is what makes the Internet an enabling
environment for freedom of expression.

1.
In the abstract, HTTP is described as a protocol for distributed and
collaborative information systems. This has clear technical
implications, but it could also described equality of nodes, which
might make this translatable in rights implications. I'm especially
thinking about the right to receive and impart information and ideas
through any media and regardless of frontiers. A distributed system
affirms and enables that by design.

Perhaps a good start is to note the words that keep on coming back in
a rights context, and word mine all RFCs for these words?

Some of these words could be: connectivity, distributed,
collabarative, reliable, scalable, caching

This could be one way of selecting new and more RFCs, and perhaps
auto-grouping them per theme.

2.
[self-descriptive message payloads] -> This means that both content
and description are to defined by the author/host system, so people
can categorize, frame and describe their content themselves, instead
of it being auto categorized.

3.
[QUOTE]
   Likewise, servers do not need to be aware of each client's purpose:
an HTTP request can be
   considered in isolation rather than being associated with a
specific type of client
   or a predetermined sequence of application steps.
[/QUOTE]

This supports innovation, development, and flexibility. Would this
have any rights implications? Or is this just very practical way of
defining a broadly used protocol? Could be linked to  'IP
disinterestness' (as mentioned above), which creates space for freedom
of expression and freedom of assembly, by supplying tools but not
defining the way in which it needs to be done.

4.
[QUOTE]
An HTTP "client" is a
   program that establishes a connection to a server for the purpose of
   sending one or more HTTP requests.
[/QUOTE]

Interestingly, as interaction starts with the request from a client.
The primacy of every action lies with the client. Which could point to
souvereignty, autonomy and/or freedom of choice. Are all services
based on a request? Are all protocols initiated by request? Would be
interesting to have a statement about the primacy of the client. How
does this relate to cookies, consent, etc? In other words: does all
automation start with clients?

Obviously not, because one can scan for open ports, ping user agents,
etc. But then one can configure a user agent to respond to this or not
(like putting robots.txt on your webserver signals that you don't want
your site to be indexed by Google).

This seems to point to deepening of this topic:

[QUOTE]
   The implementation diversity of HTTP means that not all user agents
   can make interactive suggestions to their user or provide adequate
   warning for security or privacy concerns.
[/QUOTE]

Eventhough security and privacy concerns are valid (one does not want
to give away more information than necessary), this could also fit
within a freedom of expression context where a user is free to hold an
opinions (and thus not hold or impart others!).

5.
In the client request Accept-Languages are defined. Perhaps we can
relate this to the research into IDNs (see draft) and/or use this
[QUOTE] to show the ambition of the Internet community to
   reflect the diversity of users and to be in line with Article 2 of
   the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which clearly stipulates
   that 'everyone is entitles to all rights and freedoms [..], without
   distinction of any kind, such as [..] language [..].
[/QUOTE from ID]

6.
Caching is crucial for enabling better access to information in areas
with slow connection. Could we state that through caching access to
information is improved? Further research to be done in RFC7234.

7.
What (social) requirements could be meant here? :

[QUOTE]
   Additional (social) requirements are placed on implementations,
   resource owners, and protocol element registrations when they apply
   beyond the scope of a single communication.
[/QUOTE]

8.
Strong point for slow and/or instable connections, support
connectivity where there is bad connection. Excellent protection of
the right to receive and impart info. I think we could frame this
under connecivity as well.

[QUOTE]
6.3.1.  Retrying Requests

   Connections can be closed at any time, with or without intention.
   Implementations ought to anticipate the need to recover from
   asynchronous close events.
[/QUOTE]

Looking forward to discuss!

Best,

Niels

Hi Niels--

Thanks for this effort!  A few thoughts from me below, spurred by your
initial commentary.  I apologize in advance that (when trying to read
critically at least) i adopt something of a devil's advocate position.
My comments are supportive in that i'd like to see this HR analysis
proceed from a strong and well-thought-through perspective.

On Tue 2015-02-03 11:52:39 -0500, Niels ten Oever wrote:

The idea here i think might be framed as the network being
"content-neutral".  This is supported in some sense by the satirical
April Fools' Day RFC 3514, which introduces the "evil bit":

 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3514

>>   Because NAT [RFC3022] boxes modify packets, they SHOULD set the evil
>>   bit on such packets.  "Transparent" http and email proxies SHOULD se=
t
>>   the evil bit on their reply packets to the innocent client host.

There are more serious RFCs that take the idea of a content-neutral or
content-agnostic network as a given too (for one thing, it's a common
engineering practice to layer designs by introducing deliberate
agnosticism about the layers above or below the system being specified)

Unfortunately, not all proposed standards hold this line on content
neutrality:

  https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-safe-hint-05

(of course, the above draft isn't an official RFC yet -- should we be
comparing drafts-that-didn't make it with drafts that ended up becoming
RFCs?)

With a corpus as large as the RFCs, how should this project avoid
confirmation bias?  If we look for the things we want to find, it seems
like we should probably also make sure to look for things we *don't*
want to find, to see whether they're there too. (see also: Biblical
Exegesis =E2=98=BA)

i find it a bit funny that in 1. above you're proposing auto-grouping
the RFCs themselves (presumably after fetching them via HTTP), and in
2. here you're saying that the protocol is designed in opposition to
"auto categorization".

I'm wary of the term "auto" in places like this, because i think it
removes agency.  who is doing the categorization?  even if it's
"automatic", it's under the control of someone.

I think the point you're trying to make is that the definition of HTTP
represents a communication between peers, and peers get to have the
conversation without having to talk to (or get approval from) anyone
else if they don't want to.

 (technically, this might not be entirely true: DNS and (for HTTPS) the
   X.509 certificate authority cartel are in some ways mandatory
   "brokers" when negotiating the creation of an HTTP session, even if
   they don't get a say about the content of the communication once the
   session is created)

This property is usually called "statelessness" for the server (and not
in a "smash the state" sense!).  Statelessness a useful property from a
technical perspective because it means you can have the server crash and
not have to worry about what happens to the client when it comes back up
(the client can just carry on as it was).

In practice, of course, everyone wants to introduce state because it
makes certain kinds of workflows (e.g. multipage forms, logged-in
accounts, widespread user surveillance) much more convenient.  Hence
cookies and other similar mechanisms.

But the point of defining HTTP as a stateless protocol is so that
servers *can* be implemented statelessly, for those who have engineering
constraints that preclude keeping state on the server side (e.g. a
machine with no way to write internal storage).

NFS (the "network filesystem") is another protocol that has jumped
through many hoops to keep "statelessness" for the server.  see:

 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1094#section-1.3

However, NFS as of version 4 has gradually acquired server-side state
(that is, state shared between the client and the server), while
retaining some mechanisms aimed at easing this requirement for servers
that fit certain profiles:

  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3530#section-8.14


otoh, aiming for statelessness itself doesn't have to be motivated
purely by technical goals.  For example, if you design a protocol that
*requires* the server to maintain state about its users (e.g. internet
relay chat (IRC) servers retain state about who is connected and what
channels they're connected to), you make it impossible for someone who
*doesn't* want to track their users to implement the protocol in a
non-tracking way.

Whether the push for statelessness in some internet protocols derives in
part from this urge to safeguard against ubiquitous surveillance is
pretty hard to say, of course.

I'm not sure this is anything but a technical label.  In the
client/server network communications model, the server is defined as
being the "listener".  the client is the one that initiates a
connection.

Not all protocols are client/server, though the stuff in the IETF tends
to be client-server because it's simpler to describe.

peer-to-peer protocols like bittorrent aren't client/server, for
example.  But i don't think the IETF has ever even tried to standardize
bittorrent. And while the protocol at a high level might not be
client/server, each individual communication that happens during a
bittorrent session (i'm not sure i'm using the right BT terms here -- i
don't know much about the protocol) is probably using a client/server
model, where one peer (the client at that moment) sends a message to
another peer (the server at that moment).

TCP itself supports a "simultaneous open" mode, where neither side is
the client or the server:

  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793#page-32

But there are very few attempts to use simultaneous open in the wild (i
think that STUN or TURN might use it, but i don't recall the details)

Some lower-level protocols like Ethernet (also not standardized by the
IETF) are by definition broadcast -- everyone in a given broadcast
domain receives every message, and the recipients are just expected to
filter out traffic that isn't aimed at them.

The IETF has some protocols like IP multicast that enable subscription
mechanisms that might take advantage of this lower-level broadcast
technique:

 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1112

> Obviously not, because one can scan for open ports, ping user agents,
> etc.

by scanning for open ports, you're acting as a (TCP or UDP) client.  I'm
not sure what you mean by "ping user agents".  the traditional ping
(ICMP echo request) happens at the IP layer, from host to host, where
"user agent" has no definition that i know of.

> But then one can configure a user agent to respond to this or not
> (like putting robots.txt on your webserver signals that you don't want

i think this text might confuse some people because of the terms used.
in a googlebot=E2=86=92webserver connection, the "user agent" is googlebo=
t, and
the "origin server" is the web server.  Putting robots.txt in your web
server is a configuration of the origin server.  And robots.txt is
purely advisory, encouraging (hoping?) that the connecting user agents
will respect the request.

If we're reading this in respect to human rights, i'd be more inclined
to take it from a disability rights perspective; you can't specify
something into the protocol that assumes that the end user has a visual
display that works for them, or is physically capable of selecting
choices from a presented menu, etc.

I agree with this view.  You can also argue it from the reverse, which
is that traditionally, Internet protocols concerned themselves only with
characters expressable by US-ASCII (which limits to languages that use
the latin alphabet), and the story of protocol development has been one
of expansion that covers more of the diversity of human communications
for the content that the protocol transmits.

Interestingly, though, most protocols retain the ASCII-only simplicity
for protocol messages themselves.  For example, HTTP headers are all
defined in ASCII.  HTML tags are all named in ASCII, even when the
content of the page is entirely in ideograms.  And the framing messages
(e.g. EHLO, DATA, etc) in SMTP are still ASCII and will probably always
be.  There's a subtle substrate of linguistic dominance threaded in
there if you want to go looking for it.

For that matter, the RFCs themselves are all written in English (or some
weird and formalized approximation thereof).

Caching is also a place where intermediaries are introduced into what
would otherwise be a peering relationship, though.  Caching proxies can
modify content, spoof content outright, or refuse to serve content.

the httpbis working group regularly fends off proposals for
machine-in-the-middle (MitM) caching proxies for https, which come
complete with arguments very similar to "enabling better access to
information":

https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-loreto-httpbis-explicitly-auth-proxy

actually says "possibility to enhance delivery performance" :/

I consider these arguments to be dangerous to the idea of network
security, and i'm glad that the IETF has avoided standardizing this sort
of thing so far.

i'm having a hard time parsing this myself, but i think they're saying
"most of the requirements we state in this document have to do with what
happens explicitly in a single connection.  some other requirements,
though, have scope larger than a single communication, such as how to
add a new element to this protocol, whether clients should open multiple
connections to a given server, or whether a server should publish URIs
for its own resources that it would fail to parse on subsequent
connections."  These larger-scoped requirements are the "social"
requirements.

this is definitely about the ethic of trying to connect, and robust
communications in general.  Without this baseline assumption, most
internet standards be even worse than the (admittedly not very good)
experience we've come to expect.  But it's not necessarily about
supporting connections where the underlying links might be bad.  I'd
argue that it's more about responsible handling (and awareness) of error
conditions.

Postel's law, which was taken as gospel for many years (and is named
after Jon Postel, the first RFC editor, and the author of numerous early
RFCs), emphasizes connectivity in a formulation that usually runs
something like this : "Be liberal in what you receive, and conservative
in what you send".

But within the tech security community, Postel's law is now under attack
(or at least, heavy revision).  In particular, it is understood to often
lead to buggy, non-predictable implementations that are likely to harbor
security vulnerabilities (e.g. imagine if a TCP implementation accepted
packets that had a "close enough" sequence number, instead of requiring
a correct match).  Modern security-conscious standards are much more
likely to adopt Postel's law in a more minimalist form, encouraging
implementors to drop or reject ill-formed input, while dealing
gracefully with the resulting failure conditions.

This results in less "papering over" of failures from the remote peer,
while still providing robust communications.  Maybe the underlying ethics
here are (a) transparency and (b) robustness?  Both of these are
user-centric notions -- the user should not be misled by the tools, and
the tools should not disobey the user.

AFAIK that draft is not continuing to publication. The IESG
ballot positions are at [1]. I don't know if the author plans to
bring it back or somewhere else in the same or some other form.

So I'd not concentrate on that, unless you're interested in how
the IETF process has (so far) stopped a bad idea from becoming
an RFC and proposed standard. If you are interested in the latter,
then I'm happy to help explain some of the minutiae, e.g. that
10 yes or no-objections IESG ballots are needed for a proposed
standard. (This was the first time I've ever seen 6 abstain
ballots on a draft in my 4 years on the IESG.)

I'm happy to hear this -- i think that draft represents a serious
possibility of chilling effects on speech (not to mention removal of
power from the hands of the end user), without much of a benefit in
other areas.  for example, i don't believe the existence of the RFC
would have actually stopped any would-be filter/censor from trying to
MitM HTTP or HTTPS connections.

For the purposes of looking for human rights leads, i think the process
itself would be useful as background, but in particular it could be
useful to read the comments in drafts that did not make it to RFC
status, to see how those arguments are presented.

I think the question we're asking is something like "in what ways do
RFCs reflect a human rights agenda?"  It would be instructive to observe
how things that *do not become* RFCs get shot down or set aside, since
that filtering process could also reflect a human rights agenda.

I don't know how to structure this research, though -- i'll leave that
to the experts :)

The rationale for this choice is RFC 2277. To summarize it: "protocol
elements", never seen by the ordinary user (such as GET and POST in
HTTP) are in ASCII. Text elements have to be in Unicode.

[BTW, HTML is not an IETF standard.]

Hi dkg,

Thanks for your elaborate response. No problems with a critical
stance, even for the sake of the argument, there is no progress
without critical thinking. Please be harsh :)

This is a great lead. Do you have any leads on where
content-agnosticism has been the best described in an RFC ? Content
agnosticism, together with connectivity could be the basis of
enabling of freedom of expression on the network.

I agree that it would be interesting to also look at RFCs that did
not make it, or ones that are still drafts, but I would like to keep
that for later and first see what we can still from the existing
body of RFCs, because that is already a lot.

Are there any RFCs that you know of that breach content agnosticism?
I imagine this could happen in congestion protocols, no? Or would
that be on the implementation level?

I completely agree. But knowing what we are looking for, will also
help us finding the things we don't want to see.

Adding stateless, statefull, content-neutral, transparent, robust,
user-centric and content agnostic to this list and removing caching
(as per discussion below).

New list:
connectivity, distributed, collaborative, reliable, scalable,
stateless, statefull, content-neutral, content agnostic, transparent,
robust, robustness, user-centric.

Fascinating that the argument for statelessness is reliability and
stability and introducing the concept of 'idempotence'. I would
almost like to ask the same questions as before: is there a
description of engineering standards (preferably in an RFC) that
says that a protocol should be stateless unless there are other
compelling reasons not to?

Under 8.14.1 it is mentioned that the transition needs to be done
transparent for the client, but transparency doesn't necessary imply
consent, right? Might be interesting to dig a bit deeper in what
transparency means on this level (and how it relates to consent).

I could imagine there are also plenty of other reasons to be for a
more stateless architecture (like the ones mentioned in the NFS
RFC), all seem equally valid to me, am not sure intentionality is
crucial here.

We have been thinking of including multicast in the research, but it
seems (but correct me if I am wrong) that multicast does not see a lot
of implementation in the wild, or am I overseeing something?

This might be an interesting point for research as well, since it is
about balancing fault tolerance (connectivity) and security.

Am definitely adding user-centric, robustness and transparency to the
list of topics to look for. It seems that we are slowly coming up with
relevant technical concepts that impact rights online, so this is
really helpful.

Looking at RFCs through the lens of these concepts might be
methodology we are looking for.

I can't think of any such RFCs off the top of my head.

TCP is a classic protocol example of a "layered" approach, where it is
relatively agnostic about what happens in the layers above and below it:

  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793

But i don't think the RFC makes any explicit claims to that agnosticism.

You can see in that early RFC, though, that the authors don't even take
IP for granted (as the layer "below" TCP), stating:

  The interface between TCP and lower level protocol is essentially
  unspecified except that it is assumed there is a mechanism whereby the
  two levels can asynchronously pass information to each other.
  Typically, one expects the lower level protocol to specify this
  interface.  TCP is designed to work in a very general environment of
  interconnected networks.  The lower level protocol which is assumed
  throughout this document is the Internet Protocol [2].

for the layer "above" TCP, the RFC frames it simply as:

   The data that flows on a connection may be thought of as a stream of
   octets.

Though it does also take some pains to mark out "urgent mode", which can
identify some parts of a TCP stream as higher-priority than others.  I'm
unaware of anyone actually using TCP's "urgent mode", though.   Perhaps
others with more TCP knowledge can weigh in on this.

Urgent mode appears to be deprecated in
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6093, which i have not read fully.

i don't know of such a reference :( hopefully someone with more

i think you're correct that multicast hasn't seen wide adoption.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Dear all,

To increase our understanding of the perception of human rights and
user rights among authors we thought it might be a good idea to
interview RFC authors and main actors in the IETF. Since the Dallas
meeting is coming up quickly, and these are busy people I thought it
might be a good idea to already ask people for a timeslot of ~30
minutes. I was thinking of the following people:

- - Head of IAB
	Russ Housley

- - Chair of IETF
	Jari Arkko

- - Area Directors (https://www.ietf.org/iesg/members.html) (one per
area, but allow them to self-select)
	Applications area
		Barry Leiba
		Pete Resnick
	Internet Area
		Brian Haberman
		Ted Lemon
	Real-time Applications and Infrastructure
		Ricard Barnes
		Alissa Cooper
	Routing Area
		Alia Atlas
		Adrian Farrel
	Security Area
		Stephen Farrel
		Kathleen Moriarty
	Transport Area
		Spencer Dawkins
		Martin Stiemerling

- - Chairs of WGs
	httpbis
		Mark Nottingham

Do you think this is a good list to start with?

I also drafted some questions for the interview, please let me know if
you think these are the questions that will give us the best results.

1. What is your current role in the IETF, IRTF and/or surrounding
environment and how has it changed over the years?

# Of course this is part of our pre-research, but it's always
interesting to hear how people self-define their position.

2. Which RFCs that you (co-)authorted do you deem the most relevant ones?

3. How useful do you think security considerations are in RFCs, and
why are they important?

4. Do you see any relationship between security and human rights?
Please elaborate.

these folks are typically extremely busy during an IETF week, so you may =
not be able to schedule time with very many of them.

Can you do the interview by email?

Hi,

As an applicant Research Group, we requested and got a time slot for
Dallas: Friday March 27 11:50-13:20

Niels and I are presenttly putting together an agenda.  While we will be
putting out an update of  draft-doria-hrpc-proposal, we would like to
include more items on the agenda than just this draft and wonder whether
others have any research to report in the area of human rights protocol
considerations.  Other suggestions for relevant discussions are also
welcome.

This is what have at the moment

Agenda (to start) -
agenda bash
applicant research group status
draft-doria-hrpc-proposal-00
other ....
what's next

Niels will be chairing, I will be remote

thanks

avri
