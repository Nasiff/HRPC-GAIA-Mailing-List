Regarding the human rights themselves, the idea is that the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights <http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/> is
a consensus. It is mentioned in draft but may be we should move it to
a normative reference :-)

Regarding the draft, well, that's the point of the last call, to
attract as much people as possible, for diverse backgrounds. Do not
hesitate to spread the word.

You mean Wikileaks? Indeed, it was done through the registrar (and not
the registry, specially not the .com registry since it was not a
.com). Proposal:

   There have been a number of cases where the records for a domain are
   removed from the name system due to real-world events.  Examples of
   this removal includes the 'seizure' of wikileaks [bbc-wikileaks] and
   the names of illegally operating gambling operations by the United
   States Immigrations and Customs Enforcement unit. In the first
   case, an US court ordered the registrar to take down the domain. In the
   second, ICE compelled the
   US-based registry in charge of the .com TLD to hand ownership of
   those domains over to the US government.  The same technique has been
   used in Libya to remove sites in violation of "our Country's Law and
   Morality (which) do not allow any kind of pornography or its
   promotion." [techyum]

Quite the opposite. The current text is badly written (I raised the
point several times but with little success). The idea (see the entry
Internationalization in the terminology) is that the best solution,
for internationalisation and interoperability, is to accept UTF-8
only, thus avoiding any compatibility issues. The second best solution
is to accept several charsets, which will require mandatory tagging,
to avoid guessing. The worst is of course ASCII-only. Proposal:

 Question(s): Does your protocol have text strings that have to be
   understood or entered by humans?  Does your protocol allow Unicode?
   If so, do you have accept texts in one charset (which must be
   UTF-8), or several (which is dangerous for interoperability)? If
   character sets or encodings other than UTF-8 are
   allowed, does your protocol mandate a proper tagging of the
   charset? Did you have a look at [RFC6365]?

In the Dyn case, no, the problem was excessive concentration. (In the
same way that excessive concentration of email at Gmail is not the
fault of SMTP or IMAP.)

The proposed text looks better.

It has been a while since I looked into Internationalization.  It is 
advisable to use UTF-8 to reduce interoperability issues.  It is 
similar to what you have in the first part of the proposed text.  It 
can be an issue when different encodings are allowed in a protocol as 
an encoding may not be well-supported on the receiver side.  For what 
it is worth, RFC 2277 was written in the previous century.  It may be 
easier to refer to RFC 6365 only.  The "text strings that have to be 
understood or entered by humans" is discussed in Section 6 of RFC 
6365.  Although your proposed text looks better, that sub-section 
would still look confusing.

Yes.

That is why reviews are very much welcomed and we've done considerable
outreach to get as much reviews from different perspectives on this draft=
=2E

It can also be said that Human Rights (as laid out in documents like the
UDHR, ICCPR and IECSCR) are the most universal values we have in the worl=

It will be the consensus of the research group and the people therein.
Nothing more, nothing less.

Thanks for catching that, it should have been 2026, fixed that.

Replace 'real-world' with 'political'. Thanks for the suggestion. I also
used the text that has been suggested by Stephane with this little tweak.=

Are you referring to RFC7258 ? Am not completely sure how it would fit
in here, but text suggestions are always welcome.

Default log settings have an impact on privacy, privacyis a human
rights, so I'd say, yes this could be framed as a human rights issue.

Which does not mean that one should never be able to keep logs, but
rather we should try to keep the storage and collection of Personal
Identifiable Information to a minimum.

This was badly written, I went with the proposal made my Stephane:

Does your protocol have text strings that have to be understood or
entered by humans? Does your protocol allow Unicode? If so, do you have
accept texts in one charset (which must be UTF-8), or several (which is
dangerous for interoperability)? If character sets or encodings other
than UTF-8 are allowed, does your protocol mandate a proper tagging of
the charset? Did you have a look at {{RFC6365}}?

Interesting. But is this an IETF or a protocol issue? Is this something

I think it depends on the conception of non-discrimination and equality
do not apply here, since it is equally miserable for everyone.

Why could the notification system outlined in RFC6108 not be interpreted

I do indeed think that export control impact heterogeneity, but I do not

It's not only by society. The less information is known about an
individual, the harder it is to discriminate against them. Therefore the
right to privacy and the right to non-discrimination are linked.

There is indeed also a strong link between non-discrimination and the
right to equality.

this is also why all human rights are universal, indivisible,
interrelated, interdependent and mutually reinforcing.

Security considerations here have been interpreted according to RFC3552.

It seems rather important for this document, however, to distinguish
between "protocol considerations" and "operational considerations".
Logging is clearly the latter.

What we're trying to do is to propose a HR ethics for Internet
protocols, which finds it roots in the values that are currently a
partial (and quite obscure) ethic of Internet protocols.

I think the fact that we're talking for so long about what these could
be, makes it really clear that the ethics of Internet protocols are by
far not as clear as many who have worked on the early network would have
wanted them to be. This can also be seen in the film 'Net of Rights'.

I think the sentence 'the community believe that the goals is
connectivity' is pretty clear here:

   2.1 Many members of the Internet community would argue that there is
   no architecture, but only a tradition, which was not written down for
   the first 25 years (or at least not by the IAB).  However, in very
   general terms, the community believes that the goal is connectivity,
   the tool is the Internet Protocol, and the intelligence is end to end
   rather than hidden in the network.

RFC3935 seems to have a bit thicker description here:

      The IETF community wants the Internet to succeed because we
      believe that the existence of the Internet, and its influence on
      economics, communication, and education, will help us to build a
      better human society.

Also the following description seems to negate your statement that there
is such a thing as an inherent network ethic:

 These concepts have little to do with the
   technology that's possible, and much to do with the technology that
   we choose to create.

According to RFC3935 it's about a conscious ethical choice we're making,
that we're not basing on what is possible, but on what we choose to creat=
e.

You're right that the documents are not very specific about what this
should be, and that is exactly the void that this document tries to fill.=

I think this is a misrepresentation of the draft. There is an explicit
difference between 'support human rights' (which would be an advocacy /
enforcement position) and 'respect human rights' (which simply ensures
that there is no adverse impact on human rights).

>=20

I would not have a problem with a useable inherent network ethic, if
there was such a thing. How your concept of an inherent network ethic
help us with issues like internationalization, universal availability,
and accessibility? It completely leaves the human out of the equation,
whereas the Internet is about humans, not about the Internet itself. The
Internet is not an interesting science expiriment (anymore), it is
mediating central democratic processes, the public debate, and the
global economy. The Internet does not simply exist for the Internets sake=
=2E

Furthermore, there are many different ways in which inter-connectivity
is possible, but it gives very little guidance on the hard choices we
need to make and the impact they might have.

Technology is not neutral, neither is the Internet and neither is the
IETF. The IETF already is political and also already is a political
actor. There is are ample examples of that in the book by Laura DeNardis:=


DeNardis, Laura. 2009. Protocol Politics: The Globalization of Internet
Governance. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.

as well as:

DeNardis, Laura. 2014. The Global War for Internet Governance.

I am still waiting for relevant literature that argues that technology
is ethically neutral. We've cited quite a body of literature that argues
the exact opposite. Repeating that technology is neutral will not make
it more true, but I am more than happy to be convinced.

So you are arguing here that things actually do exist outside of their
context until they are used? And that things do not order reality or
shape their usage? In that case it might be interesting to have a look
at UI/UX studies and how they are working on increasing the
understanding of the relationship between technolog and the user and how

I am afraid you're right that your position is a position in line with
Aristotelian ethics as they were current before the Second World War.
But scienctific literature and opinion has quite significantly changed
since then, partially because of the use of technology in the Second
World War. Also Artistotelian ethics have moved on. A quick search finds
two articles that argue the exact opposite:

Aristotle on Technology and Nature, Schummer, Joachim, Philosophia
Naturalis, 38 (2001), pp. 105-120
http://www.joachimschummer.net/jslit/aristot.htm

Being human in a global age of technology, Whelton, Beverly J. B.,
Nursing Philosophy, January 2016, Vol.17(1), pp.28-35

In the latter there is also a description of Heidegger and the concept
of equipment/tool/technology and mediation (or rather immediation).

I might have missed some literature, if so, I am happy to read some
books or articles per your suggestion.

Eventhough article 19 of the UDHR can be read as a description of the
Internet, we quite quickly get into problem if we look at the detailed
implications of that statement. It's not easy to bridge the legal and
the technical, but this is something we have been trying to do in this
draft.

I _really_ like this point. But I feel hesitant to go deeper into this,
because I would be tempted to go into histories of the Radiatation Lab,
FIDONET and ARPAnet. Some of this has been excellently described here:

Flichy, Patrice. 2007. The internet imaginaire. Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Pre=
ss.

and

Turner, Fred. 2006. From Counterculture to Cyberculture: Stewart Brand,
the Whole Earth Network, and the Rise of Digital Utopianism. Chicago:
University of Chicago Press.

What if I simply change the text into this?:

The open nature of the initial technical design (open standards, open
source, etc) fostered freedom of communication as a core value, the aim
was to create a network which would enable everyone to connect and to
exchange data, information and code.

All the best,

Niels

I don't find the above argument convincing and perhaps for
a reason that's useful to elucidate: we do not know that
the "wanted them to be" above applies. In my own case, I do
have some opinions that you (Niels) would likely call some
relevant ethics. In the IETF context however, I have not
found it necessary that we reach consensus on those. And I
am not at all sure we ought try - I can't see a useful
subset of my or what I imagine are others' ethical opinions
on which it'd be good for the IETF to have reached consensus,
and I really doubt that the IETF would find any such subset
on which it could reach consensus.

That is not what I claimed. Some technology is not ethically neutral.
But I do assert that IETF technology some is ethically neutral.
You seem to be asserting that no technology can ever be ethically
neutral and I disagree with that.

No, you did not provide exact opposites above. Yes, there is a body
of literature that argues as you do. It's fine that we do not all
share the exact same opinions, but would be better if the draft did
reflect that divergence.

That was not repeated because it was not stated, by me at least
and nor I think by Andrew. *Some* technology is neutral was my
assertion.

Cheers,
S.

Hi,

Some further follow up.

I think there is a difference between "connectivity" and "unfettered
connectivity to all users and for any content".  Indeed, I bet there
are countries today who think they have a goal of connectivity without
having the latter more expansive goal.

I think this puts the finger on what's bothering me, though: in my
reading the draft is too keen to take the most expansive,
rights-supporting reading of any text even when alternative readings
are available.  A more conservative approach to the literature would,
I think, actually make the draft's conclusions stronger.

This is a claim about what the community that makes up the IETF
believes, not what "the IETF" considered in itself believes.  There
may or may not be a difference between those two things.

Nope, it shows my point.  The "we" there are choosing to make
_internetworking_ technology, and that technology might itself have an
inherent ethic.  The IETF participants could choose to create
technologies that run against internetworking (arguably, sometimes
they do.  One could make the argument -- I've heard people do it --
that MPLS is not terribly internetty).

Perhaps (though I confess this distinction is not always quite so
plain to me in the text).  But I don't think that this alters the
point I was making, which is that the difference between extrinsic and
concordant values might be important.

I don't think so.  The argument, for instance, about why pervasive
monitoring is an attack _on the network_ and not on the users works
the same way.  It says (in part) that the attack is on the network
because the pervasive monitoring undermines the utility of and faith
in the network, which thereby reduces the incentives to use it, which
reduces the positive-feedback network effects of the network.  That is
_apart from_ the social costs and the attack on human users and so on.

The trouble here is that, if _that_ is the basis of internetworking,
then there is a strong position available to sceptics of this draft.
It is that engineers ought to inform but not decide policy debates.
This is the classic technocratic position: that the technocrats advise
policy makers, but themselves never make such policy decisions.  Of
course, the draft is arguing that this position is wishful thinking,
because protocols are in fact politics anyway.  But unless you deal
with the technocratic point of view head on -- and it just rejects the
postwar position about the combination of protocols and politics --
then the draft will remain subjecto attack from that technocratic
point of view.  (More on this below.)

What you claim above is that the values are in fact all extrinsic.  If
that's true, then the debate over which rights and which
interpretation (China's?  The US's?  NL's or CA's?) of the UDHR ought
to count is something that happens outside the IETF.  It remains only
for protocol designers to take these values "into account" somehow.

If, on the other hand, there is a concordant value that flows from
internetworking values themselves, then protocol engineers have a
positive duty when writing Internet protocols to consider those
internetworking values and promote them when possible.  I claim (but
it'd be a hard problem to show, I suppose) that these are a concordant
set of values that have the interesting property of supporting a
particular vision of human rights also.

It is possible that we are not in alignment about the nature of the
project.  The Internet is not merely about inter-connectivity of
nodes.  It is about inter-connectivity of networks with a particular
style of inter-connectivity in which the edges have most of the
intelligence, the individual networks interconnect without necessarily
having pre-existing contractual or other such arrangements among them,
and where messages flow from one part of the internetwork to another
without a lot of molestation from intermediate nodes.  That's quite a
lot more than inter-connectivity.  I agree that inter-connectivity
could, for instance, be achieved by the Catanet approach that a
certain IETF gadfly often promotes, and probably by something like the
old telephone networks suitably updated for packet switching.  But
those wouldn't be _internets_, even if they'd be interconnectivity.

Well, of course, that is (roughly) a metaphysical position that
basically ruled Western philosophy from at least Plato through
Descartes.  So it seems a little surprising to wave it away with a
couple rhetorical questions, especially because it undergirds the
strict separation of roles that is implied in the technocratic stance.

If your argument is at bottom that the old position is wrong because
it's old, then I fear we are far apart.  I am not arguing that old
position is true.  I am arguing that it needs to be taken seriously,
and that the draft doesn't do so, and therefore the draft is weaker
than it needs to be.

I am always leery of claims about the aim of actors in the past (and
ironically, I get even more leery when many of those actors are still
around, because I know my own motivations for what I did in the past
are now quite fuzzy to me, and I tell stories to myself about how I
got to this place where I am).  So I'd suggest this instead:


    The open nature of the initial technical design and its open
    standards, as well as developments like open source, fostered
    freedom of communication.  What emerged was a network of networks
    that could enable everyone to connect and to exchange data,
    information and code.  For many, enabling such conections became a
    core value.

Best regards,

Below is a review of draft-irtf-hrpc-research-07. I have not been =
involved in the RG so these comments are for what they're worth and I =
apologize if some of this ground has been trod before. This was an =
interesting read and most of my comments are provided with an eye =
towards making the document more useful/actionable in the IETF =
eventually, which I realize may not be a shared goal necessarily.

Substantive comments:

=3D Section 3.2.3 and 3.2.3.1 =3D

If the point of the IPv4 example is to demonstrate the human rights =
impacts -- both positive and negative -- of various protocol designs, I =
find the section to be narrow, slanted, and incomplete. It seems focused =
almost exclusively on the potential harms, which, for a protocol as =
fundamental to the operation of the Internet as IPv4, is not justified =
and renders this section somewhat useless IMO.

IPv4 is the basis for packet-switching on the Internet. What would the =
human rights impacts be if packet-switching was never invented? It seems =
to me that any evaluation of the human rights impacts of IPv4 needs to =
take this more wholistic view into account. IPv4 completely =
revolutionized networking and allowed for the amazing innovation that =
the purposes for which people were connecting could be disassociated =
from the providers of the physical circuits. Had that not happened, how =
would the capacity for human freedom of expression in the world be =
different from what it is today? I don't think an assessment of the =
human rights impacts of IPv4 can ignore this and still be credible.

The above is just one example of a fundamental aspect of the protocol =
that is overlooked in the existing analysis. Section 3.2.3.1.1 bemoans =
the visibility of source and destination addresses, while overlooking =
the fact that such addresses can actually provide a great deal of =
anonymity protection compared to other identifiers that could have been =
chosen to be made part of the protocol. Having decried address =
visibility, Section 3.2.3.1.2 then makes no mention of the fact that NAT =
can actually provide protection from such visibility.

For this section to add value, it either needs to provide a wholistic =
analysis of both the positive and negative impacts of the protocol that =
takes into consideration the space of alternative designs and outcomes, =
or it needs to state up front that it is cherry-picking a few harms =
identified as being linked to the protocol design just for demonstration =
purposes.

I think the same goes for the other examples in Section 3.2.3. The =
existing set of design and deployment decisions seem to be taken as =
givens rather than as a set of inflection points where things could have =
turned out much worse for human rights. What if the DNS hadn't been =
designed in a distributed fashion? What if we hadn't managed to make =
HTTP performant such that it could support rich media and applications =
as it does today? What if instead of the near-ubiquitous ability for =
stacks to deploy TLS we were all relying on IPSec as our underlying =
security protocol? All of those were real possibilities. Not =
acknowledging them makes the section read like a litany of criticisms =
rather than a balanced assessment of the positive and negative rights =
impacts of the protocols.

I was also surprised to see P2P, VPNs, a specific HTTP status code, and =
DDoS attacks in this section which is purportedly about protocols. This =
seems like a good bit of mixing apples and oranges; I think the section =
would be more effective if it focused on specific protocols since that =
is the unit of design most familiar to and most actionable for IETF =
engineers. Analyzing protocol-level design decisions is particularly =
important because what can be controlled within a protocol design space =
is different from what can be controlled within a particular =
implementation or deployment.

=3D Section 3.2.3.5.2 =3D

"Peer-to-Peer traffic (and BitTorrent in particular) represents a high
 percentage of global Internet traffic"

Is there a citation for this? My understanding is that by most =
measurements the share of p2p traffic is pretty low these days.

=3D Section 4.1.1.1 =3D

Two overall comments about this section:=20

(1) The questionnaire seems like it took the kitchen sink approach. Many =
of the considerations covered here are already covered in other existing =
IETF documents. In a number of cases this document took specific items =
from those existing documents and broke them out into their own separate =
subsections with many detailed questions (e.g., privacy, anonymity, =
pseudonymity, confidentiality, integrity, reliability, authenticity). I =
think most protocol designers will find the sheer volume of questions =
here daunting and will find the redundancy both within the section and =
together with existing guidance documents reason enough to skip a human =
rights analysis altogether. I would recommend really trying to =
streamline this section down to the essence of the questions that =
protocol designers are not already asking themselves but should be. If =
you want to include a comprehensive mapping between the technical =
concepts and specific human rights, put that mapping in a different =
section and focus this section on the most important and actionable =
questions.

(2) I think it would be a lot clearer if the various subsections were =
explicit about where the recommendations here are different than =
recommendations in existing IETF documents and policies. For privacy, =
security, internationalization, and extensibility, the document mixes in =
references to existing guidance/policies with its own text and =
suggestions. If the suggestion is to just go read the other documents, a =
simple reference would do; otherwise, I think the document could be a =
lot clearer about where it is asking protocol designers to depart from =
or go beyond what the existing guidance requires. Other than drawing =
explicit links between the concepts and human rights affected, I think =
4.1.1.1.2, .4, .9, .10, .14, .15, .16, and .17 could all be removed or =
replaced with simple pointers to existing documents (possibly also true =
for .5 and .12 but it=E2=80=99s not my area of expertise).

=3D Section 4.1.1.1.1 =3D

The example doesn't seem to be responsive to the question. The question =
is about requiring functionality at intermediaries whereas the example =
is about a design decision to prevent intermediaries from carrying out =
such functionality.

=3D Section 4.1.1.1.3 =3D

"Question(s): If your protocol impacts packet handling, does it look
 at the packet payload?  Is it making decisions based on the payload
 of the packet?  Does your protocol prioritize certain content or
 services over others in the routing process ? Is the protocol
 transparent about the priotization that is made (if any)?"

I think this set of questions could benefit from some refinement, in =
particular in terms of the actor(s) being targeted. I don't quite =
understand the notion of a protocol itself "looking" at a payload or =
making a decision. I'm guessing this one is actually targeted at network =
intermediaries, as in 4.1.1.1.1, since the whole point of many protocols =
is for endpoints to take some action based on packet payloads.

I also think the example in this section (and all the subsections of =
4.1.1.1, actually) would be more useful if it cited a specific protocol =
that has the effect that the section raises concerns about, because it's =
hard to understand what is being implied here. That is, I'm not sure =
what the implications would be of the answers to these questions if =
applied to, say RFC 2474 and RFC 2475, because the implications all =
depend on the deployment context.

=3D Section 4.1.1.1.6 =3D

"Question(s): Does this protocol introduce new identifiers or reuse
 existing identifiers (e.g.  MAC addresses) that might be associated
 with persons or content?  ...

 Example: Identifiers of content exposed within a protocol might be
 used to facilitate censorship, as in the case of IP based censorship,
 which affects protocols like HTTP."

I'm not sure how much mileage there is to be had out of this question =
and example, because most protocols use identifiers. I don't think this =
is a bad thing, it's just really hard to design a way to communicate =
between two endpoints about something without using identifiers of some =
sort. The question is phrased broadly enough that I think the answer =
will almost always be "yes" but I'm not sure to what end.

=3D Section 4.1.1.1.7 =3D

This section is concerning because it seems to be trying to re-interpret =
or change existing IETF policies, which seems inappropriate even for an =
informational IRTF document. For example, this bit in particular caught =
my eye:

"All standards that need to be normatively implemented should be
 freely available and with reasonable protection for patent
 infringement claims, so it can also be implemented in open source or
 free software."

As nice as it would be if this were always true, it's not, and it's not =
likely going to be any time in the foreseeable future for the 8000+ =
specifications the IETF has produced. Many of the reasons for that are =
outside the control of IETF participants. So I find it unhelpful to =
suggest these as requirements. I also don't think BCP 78 and 79 and the =
note well should be further elaborated in a document such as this one; =
even as informational people can get confused.

I would suggest deleting this section as there is a high potential for =
confusion and I'm not sure that it provides much countervailing benefit.

Also, I don't understand how the example relates to the rest of the =
section or why the emphasis on DPI is there.

=3D Section 4.1.1.1.10 =3D

The example doesn't seem to relate to pseudonymity and I'm not sure what =
is meant by a "feature." Again here giving a specific protocol example =
would be more helpful I think.

=3D Section 4.1.1.1.11 =3D

I think combining access for those with disabilities and access for =
those with poor connectivity under a single heading is confusing. These =
imply some rather disparate design decisions, not all of which will =
apply to all protocols nor in the same ways.=20

=3D Section 4.1.1.1.16 =3D

I think it would be better not to mix integrity with authentication (via =
the example reference) since you can have one without the other.



Nits:

=3D Section 1 =3D

"the privacy ... of the network" doesn't seem like the concept actually =
being described here. Usually we're focused on privacy of individuals, =
and confidentiality of corporations (e.g., network operators).

=3D Section 2 =3D

There are two different definitions offered for "Connectivity."

=3D Section 3.2.2 =3D

Accessibility is listed twice for "Right to political participation."

=3D Section 3.2.3 =3D

"For instance, relying on an external server can be bad for freedom of =
speech" -- without any further context provided, it's hard to understand =
what is meant by an "external" server.

=3D Section 4.1.1.1.2 =3D

"If a protocol provides insufficient privacy it may stifle speech" -- I =
don't think it's the protocol that would be doing the stifling.

=3D Section 4.1.1.1.6 =3D

Given that censorship is much more narrowly defined than filtering =
(presumably, although neither term is explicitly defined in the =
document), I think it would be better to use the term censorship rather =
than filtering. In some protocol contexts, filtering is an explicit goal =
and it has nothing to do with censorship.

Andrew made the point: we already have an ethics (namely an inherent
network ethic).

You seem to make the point here: we don't need an ethics, which is
different.

But it would be great if you (and maybe others) provide arguments for it
except for repeating the point.

We wrote a draft, cited literature, offered more literature, we had
several discussions about this at sessions, also at the last one, so at
this point I am not sure what I can do to address this.

Could you perhaps provide an argument why you think protocols are not
political?

All technology has the characteristic of ordering and re-ordering the
world we live in. It stimulates certain behavior, and it inhibits
others. In this way it influences our public and private sphere and thus
is political.

It does so in major ways, such as where it directly touches upon civil
liberties such as privacy and freedom of expression. But it also does so
in more subtle ways, via (lack of) availability in local languages,
centralized vs distributed solutions, and reliability and performance on
high latency networks vs low latency networks.

And of course even the possibility of making specific things possible.

This is all inherently political.

I think your argument diverges from the one Andrew makes. If you think
we should capture your line of argumentation in the draft, let's have a
discussion about it. What kind of protocols do you think are not politica=

OK - let's work it out!

That was not my point.

I said I don't believe the IETF needs to reach consensus on a
thing called ethics. I further said that I doubt that the IETF
could, in practice, reach rough consensus on such a thing.

That does not mean that IETF participants do ot do not "need
an ethics." I said nothing about that, except for my own case
where I do kinda know.

We both seem to be accusing one another of simply repeating
arguments. That usually means we're not really reading the
other's arguments;-)

It is below but once more: I assert that some IETF technology
is political but some is not political.

Here's an example. [1] While there were a bunch of "corporate"
politics around DTN, (not human rights related, but down to who
wanted to promote which technology where and when) [1] was not
at all involved in that.

You seem to be asserting that even [1] is political. Please
explain to me how that is true for that RFC as I just don't see
that.

If you assert that [1] is political because everything in the
entire universe is political then that seems to me to mean that
there is no need for the "protocols are politics" statements in
the draft - one tautology less would surely improve things if
you are correct. (And one incorrect statement less certainly
would from my POV:-)

If you can't say why [1] is political, then it seems to me you
have to accept that not all IETF technology is political. (Unless
you are asserting that "all IETF technology is political even
though it is not possible to say why for some RFCs," which'd be
quite odd;-)

S.

Hi Niel,

Ok.

Within a group of persons of diverse backgrounds, values can raise

The following is related to the previous paragraph about "values": a 
rough breakdown of the mailing list discussions shows that there were 
only participants from North America and Europe.  I don't think that 
is adequate for such a delicate matter.

According to Article19, once this document is published its 
"recommendation could be brought into the IETF to see how Human 
Rights Protocol Considerations could become inherent part of the 
standards developing process, which would be a technical translation 
of Human Rights Impact Assessments as outlines by the UN Guiding 
Principles for Business and Human Rights".  That is not stated in the 
charter of the Human Rights Protocol Considerations Research Group.

Ok.

I was not referring to RFC 7258.  The point was about not taking a 
simplistic approach to security in a high-risk environment.

Logging is not a protocol issue as such as it falls outside the 
communication boundary which was usually viewed as an IETF 
matter.  There isn't much interest in revisiting old recommendations 
which may have security implications.

I suggest dropping the last sentence and moving the reference to the 
second sentence.

This is an IETF issue.  The protocol developer may not be available 
or interested in doing an update.

Ok.

That RFC was published in the Independent Submissions Stream and not 
by the IETF.  The document explicitly states that it is not a 
standard.  To put it simply, there aren't any interoperability considerations.

I suggest discussing about this with an IETF Security Area Director.

I guess that I did not explain my point correctly.  In a country 
which is well-known, the "right" is protected through freedom of 
speech.  Anonymity is not protected through freedom of expression in 
every country.  I agree with your argument that it is about 
privacy.  Mixing this with other "rights" may be suitable when doing 
advocacy.  I don't think that it is fitting in a document about 
considerations for technical specifications.  I'll comment more at 
the end of this message.

>There is indeed also a strong link between non-discrimination and the
>right to equality.

Ok.

The question about "permissionless innovation" was not answered.  Is 
an answer ncessary given that the document describes it as "important".

Thank you for the responses.  The document comes out as pushing an 
agenda; which some readers may interpret as the preferred political 
flavor of the IETF.  Instead of explaining human rights in technical 
terms, it does the reverse by drawing a linkage between a technical 
decision and one or more rights.  I am interested in reading the data 
set mentioned in Section 3.1.2 as some parts of the document have 
similarities with promotional material which I have come across in an 
IETF context.

Regards,
S. Moonesamy

Hi all,

I am not sure if it helps if another person gets involved but I give it 
a try.

I want to comment on two things, the question of ethics and the question 
of politics.


re: ethics

This point can probably be generalised: There is nearly never consensus 
on ethics. No group ever agrees on more than single ethical statement. 
The IETF is no different in this respect from any other collective. 
Another question would be if the IETF as a group would find it helpful 
or desirable to regard its technical work within an ethical framework. 
This could be addressed in the draft document as an open issue requiring 
further debate.
>

Re political:

As a political scientist I'd like to remind you that there are many 
different understandings of 'the political'.

Political can refer to:
1.  how a standard (or any other object) is produced
2. how a standard is put to use
3. how it affects its environment
4. who selects or decides over a standard

There are probably more definitions around I am not aware of. From my 
understanding, the IETF used to distinguish technical from political 
design criteria. In other words, a choice becomes political when 
non-technical criteria play a role in or dominate protocol development. 
This definition would refer to 1 and perhaps 4.

While I was doing research on the IETF, I was always interested in how 
and where its participants draw the line between a technical and a 
political decision. An easy line to draw was that between the IETF 
(driven by technical criteria) and the ITU (organised around political 
motives). Yet, when it comes to contested design issues such as IPv6 
(which I studied at that time), the distinction between the technical 
and the political seems to blur. What is technical from one point of 
view, may appear political from another. I recall the length of IP 
addresses to be such a case in point.

It is certainly an important professional cornerstone to have a common 
understanding of the distinction between what is technical and what is 
political, this does not imply that outsiders would draw the line in the 
same way.

I do agree that to declare everything as political does not help in this 
context. Yet, I am not sure political/non-political is an inherent 
quality of a technical standard. It might be something that is rather 
ascribed to it, depending either on one's definition of the political or 
on one's position in the development work of the standard.

Best, Jeanette

I think this para refutes your interpretation:

   The Internet: A large, heterogeneous collection of interconnected
      systems that can be used for communication of many different types
      between any interested parties connected to it.  The term includes
      both the "core Internet" (ISP networks) and "edge Internet"
      (corporate and private networks, often connected via firewalls,
      NAT boxes, application layer gateways and similar devices).  The
      Internet is a truly global network, reaching into just about every
      country in the world.
      The IETF community wants the Internet to succeed because we
      believe that the existence of the Internet, and its influence on
      economics, communication, and education, will help us to build a
      better human society.

In the first paragraph the technical aspect is explained (from which you
could potentially derive a networking ethic), but the second parapgraph
clearly explains a (primitive) external ethic.

So If you then continue to explain that this quote:

We embrace technical concepts such as
   decentralized control, edge-user empowerment and sharing of
   resources, because those concepts resonate with the core values of
   the IETF community.  These concepts have little to do with the
   technology that's possible, and much to do with the technology that
   we choose to create.

means that these concepts are derived from an inherent inter-networking
ethics, I am afraid I have to disagree. Because there is also an
inter-networking solution possible without edge-user empowerment. I also
do not think that the 'values' that are referred to here are
'internetworking values'.

So here you might be guilty of the overenthusiastic hermeneutics you
accused me of earlier ;)

>=20

Could you also make the argument in relation to 'Internationalization?'
Why would the network care about human parsable languages?

The proposed 'network ethic' might provide a solution for some things,
but not sufficient. Also, it leaves quite a lot of space for
interpretation. What some people think is good for the network, might
not be seen the same by others.

Also: in your argument you now include 'faith in the network' as part of
the 'inherent network ethic', which is I think a bit of a leap, because
earlier you seemed to argue that you wanted to leave usage out of the
equation. It's starting to become a bit blurry for me here, but maybe
that's because I do not sufficiently understand your concept of a
'network ethic'.

You seem to use the term 'technocrats' here as in 'bureaucrats'. Are you
describing IETF-ers here as technocrats that take orders from policy
makers? I think that kind of goes against 'no kings, no presidents', righ=
t?

If you look at the discussion between ISO and IETF on the next
generation of IP after IPv4 I think this is also not a correct
representation.

Yes - that is exactly what 'respecting human rights' means! Fully agree!

We do not need to (re-)negogiate rights here, we should simply think
through what they mean for our field and find procedures to take them
into account.

Am happy to dig deeper into this, but then we would need a more detailed
description of 'internetworking values', and I have thusfar not been
able to find a write up of that.

I think try to understand a 'networking ethic' or any ethic that has
been prevalent in IETF has been what we've been trying to do, but at a
certain moment we got stuck because there were so many different
intepretations. I think dkg summarized it pretty well in saying: "I am
sure there are shared values in the IETF, I also think that we do not
have consensus on what these shared values are".

These guidelines are a beginning to think about that, without
reinventing the wheel, and thus looking at existing standards that are
as universal as they get: human rights.

If your position is that there is such a think as a networking ethic
that has driven the work here for many years, I can write a para about
that. Maybe I can offer rewriting the second paragraph of the Literature
and Discussion Review:

Commercial and political influences on the management of the Internet's
infrastructure are well-documented in the academic literature and will
thus not be discussed here {{Benkler}}  {{Brownetal}}  {{Denardis15}}
{{Lessig}}  {{Mueller}}  {{Zittrain}}. It is sufficient to say that the
IETF community consistently tries to push back against the
standardization of surveillance and certain other issues that negatively
influence end-users' experience of and trust in the Internet
{{Denardis14}}. The IETF thusfar has formally relied on an ethics that
is based on an understanding that the network is its own objective, and
the internetworking between networks is the expected result. There have
been hints of values that lie beyond the network itself {{RFC1958}}
{{RFC3426}}, but these have thusfar not been documented in a detailed
manner or resulted in concrete procedures for protocol design, except
perhaps for Guidelines of Privacy Considerations {{RFC6973}} and work on
Internationalization. The role human rights play in engineering,
infrastructure maintenance and protocol design is much less clear.

What do you think?

I am myself not completely sure of this because the

I hope the description above covers this.

So you really think it would add to this draft to describe pre-Kantian
epistemology and subject-object relations here? We're talking
intelectual history far before Internet Protocols or the Internet at
large, so am not sure if it's relevant. If there were modern literature
that is making this case in relation to the Internet I'd be more than
happy to discuss, and then I also think we should. I just have not been
able to find it.

I am simply not sure whether there still is such a thing as a
technocratic stance in contemporary Internet and technology related
literature.

I hope my text above helps to address that.

I think this draft does exactly the opposite, but please educate me in
how you think this happens.

May I also point to the report by the UN Special Rapporteur which made
the point about responsibility of standards bodies vis a vis freedom of
expression and other human rights, which has been adopted by the Human
Rights Council. So this is hardly a concern of a geographically limited
group.

I don't think that is true. We've had involvement in the discussion from
people from all continents and have also tried to broaden the input by
doing interviews, next to the discussions in the RG sessions of course.

I think the key word in that sentence is _could_. I do not see a
discrepancy between the charter and that remark.

Then I do not get the point. Could you restate it or offer text?

I agree this is an issue, but not within the scope of this draft.

>=20

So you propose changing:

Does your protocol have text strings that have to be understood or
entered by humans? Does your protocol allow Unicode? If so, do you have
accept texts in one charset (which must be UTF-8), or several (which is
dangerous for interoperability)? If character sets or encodings other
than UTF-8 are allowed, does your protocol mandate a proper tagging of
the charset? Did you have a look at {{RFC6365}}?

I think the last sentence add useful information. Why leave it out?

I agree this is an IETF-wide issue. But that also makes it fall outside
of the scope of this draft.

That makes it not a standard, but it is still a protocol. I tihnk this
exactly shows how a protocol can make use of permissionless innovation
to combine uses of different protocols in other ways than it was
originally intended.

Which question? There is a definition, there is an explanation among

That is quite a strong denounciation of the methodology. Could you

Have you watched Net of Rights (https://hrpc.io/net-of-rights) ? A lot

Thanks for this! Let's try to bring the discussion back to the draft. I
think the paragraph people have issues with is this one:

Protocols and standards are regularly seen as merely performing
technical functions. However, these protocols and standards do not exist
outside of their technical context nor outside of their political,
historical, economic, legal or cultural context. This is best
exemplified by the way in which protocols have become part and parcel of
political processes and public policies: one only has to look at the
IANA transition, the RFC on pervasive monitoring or global innovation
policy for concrete examples {{Denardis15}}. To quote {{Abbate}}:
"protocols are politics by other means". This statement confers that
protocols are based on decision making, most often by humans. In this
process the values and ideas about the role that a particular technology
should  perform in society is embedded into the design. Often these
design decisions are part pure-technical, and part inspired by certain
world view of how technology should function that is inspired by
personal and political views. Since the late 1990's a burgeoning group
of academics and practitioners researched questions surrounding the
societal impact of protocols, and the politics of protocols. These
studies vary in focus and scope: some focus on specific standards
{{Davidsonetal}} {{Musiani}}, others look into the political, legal,
commercial or social impact of protocols {{BrownMarsden}} {{Lessig}},
{{Mueller}} and yet others look at how the engineers' personal set of
values get translated into technology {{Abbate}},{{CathFloridi}}
{{Denardis15}}

I think this passes the test set by Jeanette, no? I think it would help
if we concretely look at text instances that are problematic within this
frame instead of continuing a more abstract discussion. I hope that helps=
=2E

Best,

Niels

I think the 'network ethic' part is more ambiguous, no? I think the
target group, or rather the 'we', are protocol developers in the IETF.

I agree we do not need consensus on a full set of ethics (we probably
never will), discussing an ethical framework, guidelines, and a way to
document choices might be useful though, no?

I am tempted to respond, but.... in the draft there is no sentence that
says 'protocols are political'. Shall we go back to the text of the
draft and see what issues there are in there? I think it's concentrated
in this para:

Protocols and standards are regularly seen as merely performing
technical functions. However, these protocols and standards do not exist
outside of their technical context nor outside of their political,
historical, economic, legal or cultural context. This is best
exemplified by the way in which protocols have become part and parcel of
political processes and public policies: one only has to look at the
IANA transition, the RFC on pervasive monitoring or global innovation
policy for concrete examples {{Denardis15}}. To quote {{Abbate}}:
"protocols are politics by other means". This statement confers that
protocols are based on decision making, most often by humans. In this
process the values and ideas about the role that a particular technology
should  perform in society is embedded into the design. Often these
design decisions are part pure-technical, and part inspired by certain
world view of how technology should function that is inspired by
personal and political views. Since the late 1990's a burgeoning group
of academics and practitioners researched questions surrounding the
societal impact of protocols, and the politics of protocols. These
studies vary in focus and scope: some focus on specific standards
{{Davidsonetal}} {{Musiani}}, others look into the political, legal,
commercial or social impact of protocols {{BrownMarsden}} {{Lessig}},
{{Mueller}} and yet others look at how the engineers' personal set of
values get translated into technology {{Abbate}},{{CathFloridi}}
{{Denardis15}} {{WynsbergheMoura}}.

Is your main problem with the quote: "protocols are politics by other
means" ?

Best,

Niels

You raise an interesting question (which, I believe, was not
explicitely discussed in the RG before): should the "human rights"
review of the protocols just an example (of the consequences of
technical decisions for HR) or should it be a comprehensive and
detailed review, with no stone left unturned?

I believe the implicit choice was to just give examples. They are
necessary because, in the IETF, many people believe that technology is
more or less neutral, and do not think that a technical choice can
have political consequences. Therefore, it is useful to have concrete
examples. But, to quote the draft, "It is important to note that the
assessment here is not a general judgment on these protocols.  When
they were conceived, there were many criteria to take into
account. [...] So, when we say 'protocol X has feature Y, which may
endanger the freedom of speech', it does not mean that protocol X is
bad and even less that its authors were evil.  The goal here is to
show, with actual examples, that the design of protocols have
practical consequences for some human rights and these consequences
have to be considered at design time."

So, I think I disagree with your review. The goal was not to give a
complete assessment of the Internet protocols (a different, and
certainly interesting work).

I don't think that IPv4 needs to be defended, its successes speak for
its importance and usefulness :-)

As I said, I think it is a different work. For instance, section 8 of
RFC 6973 does not make a "wholistic" analysis of the presence service,
and does not try to explain that it is useful.

By the way, the original versions of the draft were much more critical
of TCP/IP protocols, sometimes on the verge of paranoia.

The fact that there were worst choices do not seem to me a sufficient
reason to limit the critical analysis.

"Home" NAT, the one currently the most common for fixed-line access
does not protect at all since the public IP address identifies a
home. It could be said that CGN protects a bit, but this is not the
case for all usages of NAT.

In my opinion, this is stated in section 3.2.3.

How about "a server which is not under the direct control of one (or
both) of the parties which are communicating"?

Yes.  Note that it is a claim about "the IETF community" and not "the
IETF".  It has never been plain to me why BCP 95 makes that
distinction, but it appears to.  It's also a claim about beliefs.  But
none of this shows that IETF participants are not choosing what they
think of as "Internet technologies" as opposed to other ones.  The
point is merely that the story I've told is _consistent_ with the
outcome you appear to want.

I don't believe I said that; I certainly didn't intend to.  My point
is rather that the humans doing the work might have some extrinsic
value in mind, but the ethic of the network conveniently aligns with
those extrinsic values.  So, _even if_ a particular IETF participant
doesn't agree with some part of BCP 95, by virtue of working on
Internet technologies they might still be contributing to the same
extrinsic goal.

Really?  How?  I think this is tied to your response to my remark
about internetworking as opposed to other kinds of networking.

Perhaps I can put this differently: I think that "the Internet" is a
mass noun that denotes an emergent property, rather like "the traffic
on the Don Valley Parkway" does.  There is no _thing_, "the traffic",
that you can change.  All you can do is change constituent parts by
affecting individuals' behaviour, and so similarly with the Internet.
But unlike "the traffic", which is governed by a single set of rules
that control the road system, "the Internet" is designed so that each
participant can work out the rules between them on their own, just by
using some intercommunication primitives that are predefined.  (One
might say that the Internet is not like driving on the Don Valley, and
is more like driving in Mumbai.)

This is also different from some other kinds of cases.  For instance,
"the flow of water through the pipes in my house" is similar in that
there is no particular chunk of water that one is directing.  Yet any
given flow (as long as the system doesn't have leaks and so on) is
actually entirely under the control of my household, so it's a
centrally-run system.  And in a municipal water system, each
individual connection is via a well-regulated two-way interface
between exactly two parties.  This is very different from
internetworking, even though it's a kind of network.
 
> Could you also make the argument in relation to 'Internationalization?'

It doesn't at the protocol layer.  But it does at layers where network
identifiers or other protocol elements are exposed to users, precisely
because a larger body of users (which we can derive trivially from
"people with different writing systems than unaccented Latin in the
ASCII range of Unicode") increases the potential network effects.

This seems no objection to me at all: what some people think is good
for human rights might not be seen the same by others, or the US, most
EU countries, and China would not have disagreements over the nature
and acceptability of capital punishment (just to pick a totally
non-controversial example ;-) )

The notion of the network ethic -- and I cheerfully concede that I
have not worked this out fully, since I gave up on my philosophy
dissertation nearly 20 years ago and now only get to play in the
junior leagues in my spare time -- is that one takes the stance of the
network qua network, and consider what is good for it.  What is good
for the Internet is more internetworking, which means more networking
of other networks.  In a networking ethic, any case that causes an
increase in that internetworking is good, and any case which
reinforces increasing internetworking is a virtuous circle.  Faith in
the network by humans causes increased use, which causes larger
network effects, which causes increased use, and so on; so it is a
virtuous circle.  Therefore, faith in the network by human users is
network-ethic good (even if it is, say, bad from the point of view of
a government that wants to control the communications paths from the
country).

One view of what the IETF does is that it produces clean technical
specifications that are divorced from the policy questions in which
those specifications might be used.  Under this view, the rejection of
kings and presidents is a rejection _for the purposes of the IETF_: we
reject the idea that those with controls over the voting mechanisms or
procedural machinery get to have special influence over which
specifications get published or the contents of those specifications.
(It is not to say that there do not exist kings or presidents.  IETF
participants are sometimes accused of being unworldy, but I don't
think it extends quite that far.)

If we take that view seriously, then it follows that the IETF can
produce the best technical specification to solve a given technical
problem, and it can advise the world of that specification.  But it
cannot adjudicate whether such a specification should be adopted as a
matter of policy.  That is outside the IETF purview.  This approach to
breaking up techno-political problems -- technical people offering
"the right answer to a problem" and policy-makers stating the problem
and deciding whether it is to be solved -- is what I call the
technocratic stance.  I don't think it is unusual to the IETF, and
arguably the entire history of (for instance) urban planning is
dressed up in this same story.  Whether it is a _true_ story is, I
think, debatable.  I think you are arguing that it is _not_ true.  I
might agree with that, but what I keep trying to argue is that the
draft under discussion could be agnostic on its truth and still
produce considerations that any protocol designer could embrace.  It
could also adopt the stance that one _could_ believe the technocratic
stance is wrong, in which case one could use the considerations in the
draft.  Instead, the draft tries to argue that the stance is wrong,
but it mostly makes such arguments by appeal to authority --
authorities that anyone who embraces the technocratic stance will not
accept.  So the draft is less effective than it might be in achieving
its purpose.

No, that is certainly not my position.

I don't think the IETF has ever formally relied on any ethics, BCP 95
notwithstanding.

No, but I hope this message makes clearer what I'm suggesting instead.
If not, perhaps this is evidence of Kuhn's view about paradigms.

As I've said, this is a RG document and I have no objection to the RG
proceeding to publication.  If this were an attempt to create an IETF
document that wanted to govern IETF procedure, I'd be very strongly
opposed to going ahead, but as a RG document I am not.

It seems to me that, as far as human rights are mentioned, we decided
to use the UN declaration
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights>
as the basis.  Not that it is pefect (no human work is, and the
Wikipedia article does a good job of listing various criticisms
against it) but it is probably the best thing we can all agree on.

And, to handle this specific case, the UNDHR does not mention the
death penalty. (IMHO, it should, but this is off-topic for this RG.)

I think the controversy is over whether Section 3 of the UDHR means
that capital punishment is an abrogation of a right, which is why I
thought the analogy apt for the objection Neils raised.

That's clearly not true. There are several RFCs about logging such as 
RFC 6302, which has clear HR consequences. (There is also RFC 6269 or
7937 or 7422 or even 7011.)

The IANA transition is all process, zero protocol. (Hence adding

I'd also add:

'
Within the community of IETF participants there is a fairly
clear desire to as far as possible restrict IETF activities
to those that are as purely technical and as little political,
as is possible. Many of those participants would not accept
the proposition that "protocols are politics by other means."

Yes, and that the draft text seems to agree with that statement with
no qualifications.

Delay Tolerant Networking can be very relevant for human rights,
especially in areas with low connectivity.
As you know, Delay Tolant Networking is now also used a lot for IoT
devices, so if this technology would enable something such as an
emergency response device for human rights defenders, I think it could
be very useful as well.
One could also think of deployments similar to Outernet
(https://outernet.is/) which would improve the Right to Education.

If this RFC makes de deployment of DTN easier, and thus positively
contributes to  these things, I indeed think it is political.

Thanks for this suggestion. I thought we could maybe rewrite it like this=
:

Within the community of IETF participants there is a strong desire to
solve technical problems and minimize the engagement with political
problems.

But then I thought: would people working on privacy agree with this? I
think for a lot of them this actually _is_ a political issue (same for
people active in GAIA, etc). So maybe something like:

Within the community of IETF participants there is a strong desire to
solve technical problems and minimize its engagement with political
processes and non-protocol related political issues.

Might need some fine-tuning, but curious to hear what you think.

I fully disagree. We don't need to argue about it though so just
for the record: my reasoning is that yes aspects of DTN deployment
are political in the sense you describe, and yes aspects of DTN
protocol design were political in the corporate sense (I could go
into details, but they're still irritating to some folks so I
won't:-), but this particular aspect (use of SNDV as a way to
represent numbers) is just not political in any sense. Therefore
that RFC is apolitical too. I'd also assert that there are many
other aspects of DTN technology that are similarly purely technical
and apolitical. To offer a contrast though - whether or not to
include a checksum in bundles is something that could have been
purely technical but ended up being political (in the corporate
sense) due to the players involved. So it could have been the
case that SDNVs and this RFC were political, but the facts are
otherwise in that case. (And just to be clear: when I say
"corporate politics" I would include e.g. academic politics and
as was relevant in the case of DTN, non-technical disagreements
that happen inside even just one not-for-profit organisaton;-)

If an analogy might help: voting in elections is political,
but whether I walk or cycle to the polling station is not, in
itself, political. (It could be if I were a cycling advocate,
but in my case, my mode of transport to the polling station
is not a political act.)

Again - I'm happy to chat about the above, as it's interesting
where different folks draw the lines, but we definitely don't
need to resolve that discussion to be done with this draft. So
if someone does want to chat about that maybe best to start a
new thread.

That'd be fine if you also include this bit, which I think is
important:

'
  Many of those participants would not accept
  the proposition that "protocols are politics by other means."
'

It seems fairly clear that very different opinions on that quote
have been expressed on the RG list and that that didn't resolve
into us all agreeing with the quote.

The change control issue was probably regarded as political by nearly 
everyone involved in the debate about IPNG.

As you describe it, one could say that technical and non-technical 
concerns both played a role: performance (technical) and avoiding future 
transitions (non-technical).

Now, this is surely a non-technical interpretation of what was going on.

As you say above, the debates about address length were not purely 
technical. But some IETF people at that time discussed and regarded them 
as technical issues. So, it is perhaps more in the eye of the beholder 
or a matter of interpretation whether an issue is technical or political.

Is the goal to give the impression that those consequences are almost =
exclusively negative for human rights? Because almost every example =
given in 3.2.3 is used to emphasize how a protocol design choice has had =
a negative impact on human rights. I don=E2=80=99t think the examples in =

But at a minimum they should demonstrate both the positive and negative =
consequences of design choices for human rights, assuming people think =
that both positive and negative implications exist.

I really disagree. I think there are many people at this point who take =
the underlying design of the internet as a given, perhaps more so for =
the potential audience for this document than for a typical IETF =
protocol spec. For that reason in particular I think it=E2=80=99s =

Well, as a first-time reader, the draft came off as excessively =
negative. As noted above, I=E2=80=99m willing to concede that it need =
not be wholistic, but it would be better if it were more balanced.

I=E2=80=99m not asking to take out the criticism, I=E2=80=99m asking to =

I think the above is a good point and well worth handling in the

I propose we discuss this in person, maybe even during a hrpc RG
session. I don't think this discussion is relevant now for the draft.

Well, not counting heads is what we do:-)

I agree that saying "many" could be arguable, though I think it's
the case from my experience with IETFers. If you really feel a
need to water this down (or Avri as consensus-caller on this one
does), I could live with the weasely worded:

'
  Note that a number of HRPC participants do not accept
  the proposition that "protocols are politics by other
  means" - whether or not that means there would be
  an IETF consensus for or against that proposition
  is unclear, the question not having been asked.
'

But to be clear: I prefer the non weasel word version.

Cheers,
S.

Hi Stephane,

"What is a protocol" is a matter of debate in the IETF.  The privacy 
impact of an IETF specification was not an issue for a significant 
amount of pre-2014 IETF standards-track documents or it was viewed as 
an issue to be considered when a IETF participant or IETF Area 
Director with an interest in security or privacy raised a 
concern.  Logging takes an IETF standards-track document beyond what 
is known as "end-to-end".

Are there privacy issues in respect to logging?  Yes.  Should an IETF 
standards-track document (this is not the same as a RFC) recommend 
what information should be logged?  No.  Are there HR consequences 
when logging?  Yes.

Using RFC 7422 as an example (it is not an IETF document), it says 
that there is a "legal logging requirement".  Can the legal 
requirements of another country be disputed?

Regards,
S. Moonesamy

I suspect that most "positive benefits for HR" will be "negative
features" such as "SMTP does NOT require that the user sending an
email has a client certificate, which is good for anonymity"

What about this, I think it's a bit more elegant and says the same and
ensure we don't have repetition:

According to {{Abbate}}: "protocols are politics by other means". This
statement would probably not get IETF consensus, but it nonetheless
confers that protocols are based on decision making, most often by
humans. In this process the values and ideas about the role that a
particular technology should  perform in society is embedded into the
design. Often these design decisions are part pure-technical, and part
inspired by certain world view of how technology should function that is
inspired by personal, corporate and political views. Within the
community of IETF participants there is a strong desire to solve
technical problems and minimize engagement with political processes and
non-protocol related poltical issues.

Cheers,

Niels

I think we had this discussion in several times, mostly informed by the
presentation by Ramsey on his Arabic programming language. This resulted
in this text in the draft:

   In the current IETF policy [RFC2277], internationalization is aimed
   at user-facing strings, not protocol elements, such as the verbs used
   by some text-based protocols.  (Do note that some strings are both
   content and protocol elements, such as the identifiers.)  If the
   Internet wants to be a global network of networks, the protocols
   should work with other languages than English and other character
   sets than latin characters.  It is therefore crucial that at least
   the content carried by the protocol can be in any script, and that
   all scripts are treated equally.

Not everyone needs to agree on interpretations or implement in the exact
same way, but having a standard helps a lot to compare against. This is
why there are Universal Periodic Reviews of all countries. No country
has a perfect score sheet where it comes to human rights.

I still have some problems with this because the network is not a force
of nature, right? It came into being, based on certain ideas, and is
also still evolving. So I find it hard to pinpoint and ethics to it, and
I think that is exactly the problem, right?

> What is good
> for the Internet is more internetworking, which means more networking
> of other networks.=20

For the arguments sake: Could one not say it would be best for the
network if we not focus on the expansion of the network but improving
the quality of the network? I think this is something that could be
argued based on your networking ethics, no? Or is more always better?

> In a networking ethic, any case that causes an

So it's a numbers game? More is better? More networks, more hosts, more
packets transported, or more users?

What should we do in case we could add more users if we would add more
opportunities for censorship. How would a networking ethic help us make
a decision in such a case?

This is hardly the case, right? It's not like standards go to government

Wait, so you're _proposing_ a network ethic. I thought you were making
the argument that currently there _exists_ something as a network ethic.

I don't see how not.  The claim in the draft that is causing the
controversy is that protocols are politics by other means, that all
protocol design decisions are necessarily political, and so on.  If
consenus is desired, that's the topic that needs to get sorted out.

Best regards,

AFAIK we have addressed all text in the draft that might have insinuated
that. If not, am happy to address the text with which you have issues.

Of course, this is essentially an observation about the world, not a =
decision about what to do.   If it were to _not_ gain consensus, it =
would be because someone said something that demonstrated that it was =
not true.   We could have consensus not to actually admit to this truth, =

footprint we've placed on the face of recent history with our protocols.

Hi Niels,

My guess is that there isn't consensus in the IETF on the UDHR as 
there hasn't been any IETF discussion about that.  What this draft 
does is that it takes values from an international political context 
and tries to apply that within a standards-setting context.  The 
Introduction Section borrows a sentence from "the mission" which was 
written over a decade ago.  Is "the mission" to turn the internet in 
"a human rights enabling environment"?  Are there IETF participants 
(and attendees) who reside in "difficult" countries?  Would those 
persons feel comfortable discussing about human rights publicly 
within the IETF?

Is censorship resistance viewed as acceptable by most of the IETF 
attendees from the 53 countries?  Were there views from attendees who 
are impacted by that?  Do those persons agree that censorship 
resistance is a technical concept?

The report makes a recommendation about ensuring that there is 
"meaningful civil society participation in policymaking and other 
standard-setting processes".  It recommends that "Private entities 
ensure the greatest possible transparency in their policies, 
standards and actions that implicate the freedom of expression and 
other fundamental rights".  Is the IETF part of "private entities" or 
"international organizations"?  Shouldn't it be the responsibility of 
a person, company or organization with a strong interest in freedom 
of expression to make his/her/its case?

The issue observed by the Commission on Science and Technology for 
Development of the United Nations is that "meaningful [IETF] 
participation requires a generally high level of technical expertise, 
human rights perspectives are not always included in discussions, 
even though technical and design choices can have a substantial 
impact on freedom of expression".  I would not disagree with that 
observation as, based on my experience, it is definitely not easy to 
meaningfully participate in the IETF discussions if the person does 
not have an adequate level of technical expertise to understand where 
the technical choice is being made and the policy implications.

I suggest relying on statistics to determine whether this group is 
geographically limited or not as such facts can be easily verified.

It would be more convincing if there were public reviews from people 
from all continents.

Did the RG Chairs request feedback from the relevant IETF body to 
find out whether the "could" is acceptable or not?

Let's take the case of a person from civil society lobbying against 
corruption in his/her country.  Given the risks that the person may 
face, can he/she rely on the security mechanisms recommended by the 
IETF or should he/she do some due diligence?  The point is that there 
isn't a "one size fits all" security.

The last sentence is about making it possible for the charset to be 
identified at the receiver's end.  That does not mean that the 
information which was transmitted will be rendered correctly at the 
receiver's end as that charset may not be supported.  In essence, the 
tagging indirectly causes an interoperability issue.  Although the 
following is not a good example I'll use it for an explanation: 
https://habrahabr.ru/post/130511/  The webpage is sent with 
"charset=utf-8".  It should display correctly in any up-to-date web 
browser.  What if the webpage was sent as "charset=iso-8859-5"?  The 
up-to-date web browser would require support for that charset to be 
able to display the webpage correctly.  It is not worthwhile to 
diverge from the recommended UTF-8 as it would be quite an effort to 
solve the internationalization issues.

>I agree this is an IETF-wide issue. But that also makes it fall outside

One of the issues in the draft is that it goes into open 
standards.  It might be easier to stick to protocol discussions and 
leave out "open standards".

The first reference in the draft is to a book which costs USD 
12.95.  It is at odds with the "not available without cost".

According to Adam Thiere "permissionless innovation" is the idea that 
experimentation with new technologies and business models should 
generally be permitted without prior approval [from government].  It 
is a bit like Uber.  I unfortunately have to disagree with the above response.

>Which question? There is a definition, there is an explanation among

I commented about this above (re. permissionless innovation).

>That is quite a strong denounciation of the methodology. Could you
>perhaps be a bit more detailed about this claim?

 From what I understand, the methodology is about getting a sense of 
how the people in the IETF work, their beliefs and rituals, and their 
interactions with each other and those around them.  The actions 
within the context of this research group were embodied in some of 
the IETF RFCs.  Some of the beliefs do not usually get written into a 
RFC as those beliefs are non-technical.  It is not always possible to 
understand an IETF decision without the background information.  Is 
that background information relevant if we are discussing about 
technical details?  No.  Is it relevant if a person is interested in 
studying the beliefs?  Maybe.  There is a political flavor to 
beliefs; it is better not to have those type of discussions in the 
IETF as such discussions are usually contentious.  One interpretation 
of ideology is covered in ISBN 0252097106, 9780252097102.

>Have you watched Net of Rights (https://hrpc.io/net-of-rights) ? A lot

I watched the video.  Are those 19 persons representative of the IETF?

>What promotional material are you aluding to?

I was referring to "open standards" and "permissionless innovation".

Perhaps there is a more charitable reading, which is that the draft
tries to take values from an international political context and tries
to suggest how they interact with the relevant standards-setting
context.  (One might disagree about the degree to which it is
successful at that, but I think that the documentation of the
interaction really is the goal, not application of the values as
such.)

Best regards,

Hi,

this is a follow up from what I wrote about various definitions of "the 
political".

I would like to take issue with 2 aspects of the draft's argument. The 
first concerns the relationship between human rights and standard 
development and the second concerns the unclear definition of the 
political. I am sorry if I am being a bit long.

1. Historically, human rights enable and constrain the relationship 
between the individual and the government. Resulting from the atrocities 
of WW 2, governments agreed on various versions of human rights to 
protect the individual against the abuse of *state* power. (This means 
that human rights create obligations for the states in two ways. 
Negative rights restrict state power to protect the individual against 
it; positive rights make it mandatory for the state to deliver certain 
services to enable a dignified life of its citizens. I.e. a right to 
internet access, as in Mexico, Spain and a few others.)

Human rights concern and structure the relationship between citizens and 
public authorities, they do not affect the horizontal relationships 
between citizens or between citizens and companies, standard setting 
bodies etc. In fact, the products and services of many commercial 
companies affect human rights in fundamental ways but it does not follow 
from these affects that they have to modify their actions.

However, there have been debates over the past decades that question the 
restriction of the applicability of human rights to the relationship 
between individuals and their governments. (Likewise, there are many 
debates about restricting the applicability to citizens since on the 
Internet we are mostly foreigners).

Experts are divided over the question of expanding the applicability of 
human rights to the relationship between individuals and the private 
sector. Some fear that this could weaken the power of human rights. 
Others argue that there is no legal infrastructure to ever enforce 
compliance by the private sector, and that enforcing human rights is the 
task of governments. This is a very interesting debate, and the spread 
of digitalisation has fueled it in many ways.

I think it is very good that the IETF takes an interest in this debate 
and that it considers its position with regard to the respect to human 
rights. The fact that human rights bind governments but not societal or 
commercial entities does not imply that non-state actors cannot commit 
themselves to take human rights into account and respect them.

So, my question is what does all of this have to do with whether or not 
standard setting is a political activity? In my view, all the 
controversial references to "protocols are politics by other means" can 
be dropped  from the draft. They do not add anything substantial to the 
proposal.

The essential question is whether, to what extent and in which form the 
IETF wants to take into account that its work does impact the human 
rights of internet users. It is unlikely that anybody seriously doubts 
that internet standards affect the exercise human rights. But what 
follows from that is much less obvious.

2. The draft constantly confuses political effects and intentions of 
protocol development. The fact that a protocol does have politica 
effects does not necessarily make its development a political process. 
If Janet Abate concludes in her very good book that "protocols are 
politics by other means", it is not clear if she refers to the effects 
of protocols or to the intentions of protocol developers. Based on the 
interviews I did back in the 1990s, I would claim that many people 
involved in the development of IPv4 became aware of the political 
dimension of their work (to the extent that it was competing against 
another protocol suit) but this political dimension did not drive their 
work. Many of the early developers primarily wanted to connect computers 
and experiment with network architecture design not code a political 
statement.

This is why I suggested distinguishing various definitions of "the 
political" Political can be an effect or an intention or both. But it is 
not ok to conclude from effects on the intentions of action.

I could add a 3. criticism that concerns the idea of hard coding or 
"baking" human rights into protocols. I think this is misguiding 
language that unduely simplifies the ways values and norms find their 
way into technology. But I will leave at that because this post gets too 
long for consumption.

My conclusion is that the draft should be completely rewritten. It 
should entirely drop the "the Internet is political". It should make the 
case why the IETF should take human rights into account although there 
is no formal obgligation to do so. And based on that, it should suggest 
various ways by which this could be done.

It is demonstrably not true that ALL protocol decisions are political.=20
We don't encode passwords in the clear, for instance, because the
probability of them being stolen approaches 1 over time.  Whether the
draft actually says that, quite frankly, is hard for me to determine.=20
Also, it is enough to debate that some protocol decisions are inherently
political.  And as Jeanette Hoffman wrote, it is sometimes tricky to
tease out which is which.

This leads me to a point: I wonder if there is room for more than one
work in this space in this research group.  Just teasing out political
from technical seems like a good piece of work on its own.

Color me confused (again).

There are two interpretations of what you wrote above- that Andrew's
observation is false-

 1. because governments do not have approval of standards, or
 2. because policy makers are free to ignore whatever approach the IETF
    puts forth.

Certainly the latter premise is true, but it is not clear to me that is
what you meant nor that it invalidates Andrew's point about the division
of labor (rather it restates it).

It is the second. But policy makers don't really have a say about what
protocols are being used. Maybe there could be a theoretical case, or in
the narrow cases of crypto exports control, but external government
intervention in Internet protocols (outside of NSA + crypto) is hardly a
thing we encounter regularly, right? Or am I wrong to assume this?

Niels

This is an OpenPGP/MIME signed message (RFC 4880 and 3156)
--u9Q3m2UwbJO47n17Wact9Wtc1N6eDeb3B
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=windows-1252
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

I added some sentences to the third para in the introduction:

Open, secure and reliable connectivity is necessary (although not
sufficient) to excercise human rights such as freedom of expression and
freedom of association {{FOC}}, as defined in the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights {{UDHR}}. The purpose of the Internet to be a global
network of networks that provides unfettered connectivity to all users
and for any content {{RFC1958}}. This objective of stimulating global
connectivity contributes to the Internet's role as an enabler of human
rights. The Internet has given people a platform to exchange opinions,
gather information, enabled people of different background and genders
to participate in the public debate whereas this might have been hard
for them to do so before, and it has allowed people to congregate and
organize. Next to that, the strong commitment to security {{RFC1984}}
{{RFC3365}} and privacy {{RFC6973}} {{RFC7258}} in the Internet's
architectural design contribute to the strengthening of the Internet as
a human rights enabling environment. One could even argue that the
Internet is not only an enabler of human rights, but that human rights
lie at the basis of, and are ingrained in, the architecture of the
networks that make up the Internet. Internet connectivity increases the
capacity for individuals to exercise their rights, the core of the
Internet, its architectural design is therefore closely intertwined with
the human rights framework {{CathFloridi}}. The quintessential link
between the Internet's infrastructure and human rights has been argued
by many. {{Bless}} for instance argues that, 'to a certain extent, the
Internet and its protocols have already facilitated the realization of
human rights, e.g., the freedom of assembly and expression. In contrast,
measures of censorship and pervasive surveillance violate fundamental
human rights.' {{Denardis15}} argues that 'Since the first hints of
Internet commercialization and internationalization, the IETF has
supported strong security in protocol design and has sometimes served as
a force resisting protocol-enabled surveillance features.' By doing so,
the IETF enabled the manifestation of the right to privacy, through the
Internet's infrastructure. Additionally, access to information gives
people access to knowledge that enables them to help satisfy other human
rights, as such the Internet  increasingly becoming a pre-condition for
human rights rather than a supplement.

Curious to hear what you all think of this.

Best,

Niels

Perhaps a tangent but one early motivation for the establishment of
public libraries was so any citizen could access a copy of the laws.

How else could they?

And isn't access to the law a particularly fundamental right?

Much grows out of that one observation.

With paper libraries in decline the evolution of thought seems to me
obvious:

We mustn't decide that online access to the law is a sufficient
replacement while not also ensuring careful guarantees of easy,
reliable, and accurate access. And the privacy and security of that
access.

Hi Andrew,

According to the Charter, one of the outputs is to "define any 
possible protocol considerations".  That may be similar to the 
"interact" and "interaction" in the above.

Hi Jeanette,

[This message will not be displayed correctly in the thread as I did 
not reply to a message from the thread]

For context, please see 
https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/hrpc/current/msg00776.html

If standards setting is a political activity it would mean that the 
IETF is a political organization.  The first issue is that some 
persons would either be unable to participate in the IETF because 
they are either not allowed to take part in political activities or 
because they will face negative consequences in the country where 
they reside because of the affiliation.

There is a question about an IETF standard at 
https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/perpass/current/msg01765.html 
Is it acceptable for the IETF to make a statement about whether the 
European Parliament is infringing on the human rights of its citizens?

Does an IETF action have a political implication?  There is the 
protocol development side and the policy side.  The action of 
approving the development of a protocol within the IETF is not a 
technical decision.  There may be a political effect if the software 
or hardware in which the protocol is implemented has an effect which 
is contrary to what the government of a country would like to 
see.  Was it the intention of the IETF body to cause that effect to 
happen?  It is not possible to determine that without looking at an 
actual case.

There is a significant difference between the early network 
architecture design and the networks of today.  There has been 
several cases over the last year where it could be said that freedom 
of expression was hindered at a national level.  If a political 
statement was coded in to ensure freedom of expression, it should 
have been possible to prevent that from happening.

S. Moonesamy

Those sentences together represent a pretty bold claim.  Could you say more?

Hi Andrew,

>Those sentences together represent a pretty bold claim.  Could you say more?

The first sentence is not linked to the second sentence.  I would 
list protocol development as what working groups are doing 
(development side).  I would list decisions about how the IETF should 
work as the policy side, e.g. 
https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/ietf/current/msg100277.html

For the second sentence, taking websockets as an example, the 
protocol being developed would be a technology for bidirectional 
communication between an HTTP client and an HTTP server that provides 
greater efficiency than previous approaches.  The decisions which the 
working group takes would usually be about technical details, e.g. 
how should the future protocol interact with a HTTP server.  The 
decision about whether such a protocol should be developed within the 
IETF would not be technical; it would, for example, depend on whether 
a group of persons are interested in doing that work, what should go 
into the proposed charter, etc.

Is there anything "political" to any of the above?  There is one 
description of "the political" at 
https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/hrpc/current/msg00744.html  The 
IETF doesn't have any say in (2) as the software developers decide 
about whether to implement the websocket protocol and how to use 
it.  Are there any political implications?  I read Section III and IV 
of 
https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G16/095/12/PDF/G1609512.pdf?OpenElement 
to figure out the human rights angle.  The only point which might be 
relevant to the technical standard is the security considerations for 
the protocol.  There is a discussion about that, from a technical 
perspective, in the IETF RFC.

Regards,
S. Moonesamy

Hi Jeanette,

You might want to have a look at the UN Guiding Principle for Business
and Human Rights [0] as well as the report by the UN Special Rapporteur
on Freedom of Expression on 'Freedom of expression, states and the
private sector in the digital age' [1] which both explicitly deal with
the relationship between human rights and companies, as did the UN
Global Compact before.

The report of the Special Rapporteur even explicitly mentions standard
setting bodies.

Cheers,

Niels

Hi Niels,

I know these principles. They are one laudable attempt among several 
aiming to expand the scope of applicability of human rights to the 
private sector. They are not binding and, so far, they have not been 
overwhelmingly successful. They sort of confirm what I said, that the 
IETF, as much as any other non-governmental organisation, should 
clarify its relationship to human rights. The same is true for the 
reports by UN Special Rapporteurs etc. They don't entail any 
obligations, they specify recommendations.


> The report of the Special Rapporteur even explicitly mentions standard
> setting bodies.

And what follows from this?
And how is this related to the question as to whether or not the IETF's 
work is political?

It is not for me to say whether the IETF would benefit from clarifying 
the political dimension of its work. But it is obvious to me that 
different understandings of what is political are used on this list, and 
that it is not helpful for the discussion to mix them.

I would repeat that deciding to respect human rights does not follow 
from creating standards with political impacts. I don't understand why 
the draft links these two issues.

(Here is a different argument one could make in favor of including human 
rights into the framework of standard setting for the internet: until 
the privatisation of the telecommunication sector in the 1980s and 
1990s, telecommunication used to be a public service in many if not most 
countries. As long as they were under public control, telecommunication 
providers and services had to respect human rights. Given the importance 
this sector now has for our everyday life, it would make sense to expand 
the scope of human rights to this sector.)

Jeanette

I dont think this is stated in the draft (as it is now).

Else, could you point me to the text you have an issue with?

While I tend to agree with you overall that getting rid of the
protocols-are-politics text from the draft may be better, I'm
afraid that I'm not at all sure the above is a good thing to
include either, for political reasons;-)

The political reason to not add text like the above is that it
could be read to imply that government controlled telcos (which
do still exist) should have control over the Internet on the
basis that it's only those that might respect HR. I don't think
that'd be a good statement to make both because it's not correct
and because it'd be liable to be misquoted for mischief in some
contexts.

Cheers,
S.

PS: I'm still ok if the text Niels and I ended up with after
wrangling the other day is included.

Because the literature shows different positions on the 'societal impact
of protocols'. It shows how technology performs more than a merely
'technical function'.

Hi Alissa,

Thank you very much for this very thorough review. I made quite a few
changes based on this. All changes can be found here:

Please find my response and some questions inline (and sorry for the

As outlined in a subthread by Stephane and Stephen, this part did not
aim to do an in-depth Human Rights Impact Analsysis of a single protocol
but merely establish that there is a relationship between human rights
and protocols based on case studies.

I do hope one of the following hrpc drafts indeed can be the development
of a model for a Human Rights Impact Assessment of protocols, and maybe
even for of combinations of protocols (because that of course brings in
different vectors). This will needs more research and experimentation
though.

I do agree that the cases are a mix of things (even though all have
related RFCs)  but we exactly aimed at a mix of things so see what
different relations between protocols, standards and human rights could
look like.

I'm sorry to hear that you found the overall tone quite negative.
Therefore I added some extra positive text here:

This is the most recent stat I could find on this:

>=20

Thanks for this suggestion. I do agree that there are double parts, and
the parts that are doulbe, are also clearly referenced as such. What we
tried to do is create a clear human rights lens to specific problems,
that's why I  do not think the current parts are redundant.

Also: I think that providing a reason for people to look at those
documents increases that chance that they actually will, instead of just
saying: have a look at this.

The paragraphs that you outline above are already pointing to the other
documents. The guidelines are not means to replace BCP72 or RFC6973, but
provide another perspective for looking at protocols from a human rights
perspective, and providing extra motivation for people to look at the
these standards, because many of them (Internationalization, etc) are
not as commonly use as we might like.

The example shows that one can implement message encryption in different
ways, right? But maybe I am misunderstanding your question.

s/looking at packet payload/use data from the packet payload

>=20

As well as protocols that might make use from packet payload data
instead of only using data from the header.

>=20

I would be hesitant to target this at specific protocols, because that
might exclude other protocols for which this could be relevant as well.
I think the first sentence already is kind of a pre-selection, right?

>=20

Re-using identifiers might be a bad thing for de-anonymization, and if
something can be implemented stateless, it might also be better for
privacy, right?

I think the last two questions in this para are key for providing
perspective:

Can your protocol contribute to filtering in a way it could be
implemented to censor data or services? Could this be designed to ensure
this doesn't happen?

I also think the example provides quite some framing which also shows
the boundaries of this question.

How is this not in-line with BCP78 ? I think this is exactly what BCP78
says, the standards are available freely by the IETF.

Changed into:

Example:

Designing a standard that exposes private information, it is important
to consider ways to mitigate the obvious impacts. Pseudonymity means
using a pseudonym instead of one's "real" name. There are many reasons
for users to use pseudoyms, for instance to: hide their gender, protect
themselves against harassment, protect their families' privacy, frankly
discuss sexuality, or develop a artistic or journalistic persona without
retribution from an employer, (potential) customers, or social
surrounding. {{geekfeminism}} The difference between anonymity and
pseudonymity is that a pseudonym often is persistent. "Pseudonymity is
strengthened when less personal data can be linked to the pseudonym;
when the same pseudonym is used less often and across fewer contexts;
and when independently chosen pseudonyms are more frequently used for
new actions (making them, from an observer's or attacker's perspective,
unlinkable)." {{RFC6973}}

I agree, I guess the problem lies in the word 'accessibility'. That is
why we're offering different definitions for that in the glossary as
well. Any suggestion on how we might improve this?

I separated the two and created a different example.

Thanks, fixed!

>=20

You mean this?

: The extent to which a device or network is able to reach other devices
or networks to exchange data. The Internet is the tool for providing
global connectivity {{RFC1958}}.
Different types of connectivity are further specified in {{RFC4084}}.


The first one provides a definition and the second a subcategorization,
right?

Thanks! That should have been connectivity!

s/external server/centralized service

>=20

Thanks, changed into:

If a protocol provides insufficient privacy protection it may have a
negative impact on freedom of expression as users self-censor for fear
of surveillance, or find themselves unable to express themselves freely.

If the section is specifically designed to present cases that cut across =
protocols, implementations, and networking paradigms, it should say so =
up front. The title and introduction to 3.2.3 indicate that the section =
is about protocols.

I think this helps, but what would be better would be specific text in =
the intro to 3.2.3 that explains that the emphasis of the examples is on =
adverse impacts to human rights. Perhaps even better would be to remove =
the positive examples and just focus exclusively on the negative ones, =
so it=E2=80=99s clear that the thrust of the entire section is to =
provide negative examples.

If you=E2=80=99re comfortable citing Sandvine=E2=80=99s numbers as the =

Just to re-state the point: as someone who is quite familiar with the =
content of a number of the referenced specs, it=E2=80=99s not clear to =
me whether these sections are asking me to use a different set of =
considerations from those specs or not. I suspect other readers would be =

An instant messaging protocol might be designed such that intermediaries =
can make use of application-specific functions. That same protocol might =
support end-to-end encryption, or protocol designers might later design =
enhancements to the protocol that facilitate end-to-end encryption (an =
analogous example for real-time media would be PERC). Whether a protocol =
allows for application-specific functions at intermediaries and whether =
it supports end-to-end encryption can be mutually exclusive design =
decisions.=20

Is the implication supposed to be that protocols that require endpoints =
to take action based on payload data are somehow better for human rights =
than those where endpoints are expected to take action solely based on =
header data? I don=E2=80=99t understand why that would be. Also, the =
distinction between payloads and headers is not clear, since a header at =
one layer is a payload at the next layer.

I guess the label =E2=80=9CExample=E2=80=9D caused me to expect, well, =
an example of how each consideration might apply to a specific protocol, =
so that as a protocol designer I could learn the logic of how it might =
apply to my protocol. But if the text under each =E2=80=9CExample=E2=80=9D=
 label isn=E2=80=99t really meant to provide an example, perhaps it =
should be labeled some other way?

I don=E2=80=99t think it=E2=80=99s accurate to make those claims =
generically. My SDP implementation might re-use SSRCs with no impact one =
way or another on anonymity. And using identifiers doesn=E2=80=99t =
necessarily imply any state is being maintained. If you could add a few =
examples of protocols that exchange content without using identifiers, I =
think I would be more convinced that the generic question about content =
identifiers has utility.

I don=E2=80=99t really understand the example TBH. It talks about =
filtering based on IP address but then cites HTTP 451, whose use might =
have nothing to do with IP-based filtering.

If you can find the text in BCP 78 that says the above, please cite it. =

That is one of the definitions given. The other definition is at the end =
of the section:

Connectivity  The combination of the end-to-end principle,
      interoperability, resilience, reliability and robustness are the

I think this rides right over a distinction that is important, and
that I think _is_ sometimes made in the draft.  Some things are
constraints on the political without themselves being political,
unless one casts the term "political" very widely.

The value of , for instance, despite once having been the obstacle to
someone's political goal, is not itself a political thing.  The
emissions of carbon and contamination of water as a result of
extraction of bituminous sands in Canada are not political things,
even though those raw facts are used in various political discussions
and stand in the way of some people's preferred policy outcome.  

Now, if one adopts certain views about the nature of truth, one
_might_ decide that these are political anyway.  So, some say,
since only propositions are true and since all propositions are in
language and since all languages happen in a socio-linguistic context,
then all truth is socio-linguistically bound.  And if one adopts
certain views about the nature of socio-linguistic situations, then
all such socio-linguistic interactions are inherently political.
There is a thread starting roughly with Wittgenstein leading through
Rorty that can be read this way.  There is almost certainly a
reasonable reading of Derrida that sounds like this.  There is an
extremely reasonable reading of Michel Foucault along these lines.  And
some people think that the social constructivist interpration of
science (so, say, Bruno Latour and Andrew Pickering and _maybe_ Donna
Haraway) says this too.

However much I believe those views, it is very far from obvious to me
that such an interpretation of "facts" or "truth" would be widely
shared around the IETF.  If one is going to rely on such a view then I
think it's going to need a fairly serious airing of the arguments in
favour of it.  The draft has been altered, I think, to get away from
this problem a little bit, so I think this is less of a problem for
the draft as it stands now.  But I don't want to allow the conflation
of these two issues to stand anyway.

Best regards,

A

Unfortunately, I didn't manage the full review write-up after returning
from holidays today. Nevertheless, I have some general comments and try
to provide more detailed comments later today.

Overall, I think the draft is good to raise awareness for
the issue that sometimes technical decisions may impact human rights.
However, it falls a bit short on the problem that even human rights
get in conflict with each other and that conflict resolution is
hard to decide on, or is maybe not possible or desirable to built
into a technical system (because it's too rigid then).
For example, considering anonymity and authenticity at the same time is
not easy (cf. the APIP design
http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2626306). Sometimes it may be better
to refrain from
embedding technical solutions (i.e., specification and
operationalization) and think of institutionalization, i.e.,
considering solutions based on policy/governance or choice and markets.
Technical support for such solutions can sometimes be beneficial (e.g.,
providing transparency solutions). More details here:
http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2935634.2935640
or slides for the impatient:
http://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2016/files/program/sigcomm/SessionCCR-Paper02-Values-Carsten-Slides.pdf

There are some inaccuracies with the vocabulary section and I have
several comments for section 4. I'll come back to that later in more detail.

Best regards,
 Roland

Hi Niels,

>Because the literature shows different positions on the 'societal impact

>'technical function'.

If I understood the above correctly, what you are saying is that 
"technical standards" are not neutral.  For example, the technical 
standard(s) may directly or indirectly give a country or entities in 
a country an economic or political advantage, sometimes, at the 
expense of other countries.  That is the central thesis of one of the 
books cited in the draft.  It is also being argued that public policy 
is part of all this, i.e. it is not a technical function if public 
policy is included.  There are research papers in which all this is 
discussed from a "standards-setting" perspective.

Regards,
S. Moonesamy

This section aims to address that:

   Human rights can be in conflict with each other, such as the right to
   freedom of expression and the right to privacy.  In such as case the
   different affected rights need to be balanced.  In order to do this
   it is crucial that the rights impacts are clearly documented in order
   to mitigate the potential harm in a proportional way.  Making that
   process tangible and practical for protocol developers is what this
   research aims to ultimately contribute to.  Technology can never be
   fully equated with a human right.  Whereas a specific technology
   might be strong enabler of a specific human right, it might have an
   adverse impact on another human right.  In this case decisions on
   design and deployment need to take this into account.

You think this is inadequeate? If so, would you have text suggestions?

> into a technical system (because it's too rigid then).

This sections aims to address this:

ur position is that hard-coding human rights into
   protocols is complicated and changes with the context.  At this point
   is difficult to say whether hard-coding human rights into protocols
   is wise or feasible.  It is however important to make conscious and
   explicit design decisions that take into account the human rights
   protocol considerations guidelines developed above.  This will ensure
   that the impact protocols can have on human rights is clear and
   explicit, both for developers and for users.  In addition, it ensures
   that the impact of specific protocol on human rights is carefully
   considered and that concrete design decisions are documented in the
   protocol.

You think this is inadequeate? If so, would you have text suggestions?

Do you think this is a sufficient representation of your positions?

   Bless and Orwat [Bless] represent a fourth position.  They argue that
   it is too early to make any definitive claims, but that there is a
   need for more careful analysis of the impact of protocol design
   choices on human rights.  They also argue that it is important to
   search for solutions that 'create awareness in the technical
   community about impact of design choices on social values.  And work
   towards a methodology for co-design of technical and institutional
   systems.'

I'd me more than happy to have a bit more elaborate description.

At the Seoul face-to-face meeting, someone (Stephen Farrell, I
believe), said that this important Internet-Draft would be publsihed
outside of the HRPC RG, as an individual publication. But now it
expired :-(

[Such a document ages quite quickly. Publishing it in one or two years
would probably be useless.]

I'm chatting with Joe about progressing that as an AD
sponsored IETF draft. That's been a bit delayed for good
reasons but I hope we'll get IETF last call started soon.

Hi,

> There are some inaccuracies with the vocabulary section and I have
> several comments for section 4. I'll come back to that later in more detail.

Here we go...
Since other work prevented me to follow the hrpc list closely in the
last weeks, I apologize for repeating some comments that others already
made.

Abstract:
---------
IMHO the abstract should not start with a "list of sections" it
provides. It should rather start with the main issue of providing
considerations on human rights in protocols (or protocol design),
comprising proposals for consideration guidelines, vocabulary,
and a description of the methodology as well as a coarse literature review.

Introduction:
-------------
I find it a bit confusing to directly start with citations without
setting the context first, so probably move the citations somewhere
into the text, where they fit.

In a broader sense, protocols touch also other values, not only
human rights. So probably, a short motivation should be given, why
this draft/RG concentrates on human rights.

While the draft talks a lot about human rights, it doesn't list
a few of them as examples (e.g., at least those used later in section
4). Therefore, I propose to extend the vocabulary and also define
"human rights" there (it's ok to list some of them and repeat the
references for further details...).

Typo: "This has led to an broad" -> "This has led to a broad"

"The purpose of the Internet to be a global network of networks that
provides unfettered connectivity to all users and for any content
[RFC1958]." -> I couldn't find this statement in RFC 1958.
(general comment: please be more accurate when you cite documents, this
also applies to several other places, esp. in the vocabulary, see below).
RFC 1958 talks about connectivity as a goal of the Internet
architecture, but doesn't mention "unfettered connectivity to all users
and for any content".

"Additionally, access to information gives people access to knowledge..."
-> probably qualify this by using "generally accessible information"
or "freely available information" (some information on the Internet
isn't freely accessible or available for all on purpose).

"In order to do this it is crucial that the rights impacts are clearly
documented in order to mitigate the potential harm in a proportional
way." -> I find this statement problematic.
Sometimes the impacts are complicated since several rights
may be affected at once. Moreover, how to actually balance between
conflicts isn't clear at all sometimes.
So I don't know what "mitigate the potential harm in a _proportional
way_" actually means nor how to achieve it...

Vocabulary:
-----------
"Authenticity" -> while other security terms are taken from RFC 4949,
this one isn't (any other reference for this particular definition?).
Usually Authenticity includes data integrity as defined
in RFC4949 (just stating that it is strongly linked with integrity
is IMHO a bit too weak).

Censorship isn't defined but used in the definition of Censorship
resistance.

Confidentiality: the definition isn't correct (unintended ->
unauthorized) and also isn't taken literally from RFC 4949 although
referenced... better replace it with the definition from RFC4949.

End-to-End:
- Typo "principal -> principle"
- This definition here mixes "end-to-end transparency" issues with
  the "end-to-end argument in systems design" (the Saltzer, Reed, Clark
  paper). I think it is indeed
  clearer to separate the two (see also
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2775 and
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4924).

Hi,

I'm very sorry, I accidentally hit the send button too early, so please
ignore this version, a more complete one will follow... :-]

Bloomberg TV is running a feature on "The Dark Side of Algorithms",
interview guest Cathy O'Neil author of "Weapons of Math Destruction".

It runs periodically, only a few minutes long.

A lot of it touches on what we all know.

But she does make a good general point about how something algorithmic
rights violations causes is they intimidate people who feel they
aren't equipped to argue about flaws in "algorithms".

It raises the question of: Just as when people are intimidated by
legal jargon and seek lawyers whom should they seek if they feel their
rights were violated by an algorithm (or protocol)?

How many lawyers, for example, are competent to build such a case? Or
without needing to immediately resort to expensive expert witnesses
etc. over what probably should be a relatively minor matter.

But it's the public airing which is probably most interesting.

Hi,

> There are some inaccuracies with the vocabulary section and I have
> several comments for section 4. I'll come back to that later in more
detail.

This write-up took much longer than expected...
Since other work prevented me to follow the hrpc list closely in the
last weeks, I apologize for repeating some comments that others already
made.

tl;dr:
Major issue from my perspective:
the rationale why certain technical concepts or properties impact
particular human rights is often missing. In many cases it remains
unclear how/why certain human rights are listed in figure 2 and
section 4 while others aren't. This really needs to be fixed IMHO.

Detailed comments:

Abstract:
---------
IMHO the abstract should not start with a "list of sections" it
provides. It should rather start with the main issue of providing
considerations on human rights in protocols (or protocol design),
comprising proposals for consideration guidelines, vocabulary,
and a description of the methodology as well as a coarse literature review.

Introduction:
-------------
I find it a bit confusing to directly start with citations without
setting the context first, so probably move the citations somewhere
into the text, where they fit.

In a broader sense, protocols touch also other values, not only
human rights. So probably, a short motivation should be given, why
this draft/RG concentrates on human rights.

While the draft talks a lot about human rights, it doesn't list
a few of them as examples (e.g., at least those used later in section
4). Therefore, I propose to extend the vocabulary and also define
"human rights" there (it's probably enough to list some of them and
repeat the references for further details...).

Typo: "This has led to an broad" -> "This has led to a broad"

"The purpose of the Internet to be a global network of networks that
provides unfettered connectivity to all users and for any content
[RFC1958]." -> I couldn't find this statement in RFC 1958.
(general comment: please be more accurate when you cite documents, this
also applies to several other places, esp. in the vocabulary, see below).
RFC 1958 talks about connectivity as a goal of the Internet
architecture, but doesn't mention "unfettered connectivity to all users
and for any content".

"Additionally, access to information gives people access to knowledge..."
-> probably qualify this by using "generally accessible information"
or "freely available information" (some information on the Internet
isn't freely accessible or available for all on purpose).

"In order to do this it is crucial that the rights impacts are clearly
documented in order to mitigate the potential harm in a proportional
way." -> I find this statement problematic.
Sometimes the impacts are complicated since several rights
may be affected at once. Moreover, how to actually balance between
conflicts isn't clear at all sometimes.
So I don't know what "mitigate the potential harm in a _proportional
way_" actually means nor how to achieve it...

Vocabulary:
-----------

"Authenticity" -> while other security terms are taken from RFC 4949,
this one isn't (any other reference for this particular definition?).
Usually Authenticity includes data integrity as defined
in RFC4949 (just stating that it is strongly linked with integrity
is IMHO a bit too weak).

Confidentiality: the definition isn't correct (unintended ->
unauthorized) and also isn't taken literally from RFC 4949 although
referenced... better replace it with the definition from RFC4949.

End-to-End:
- Typo "principal -> principle"
- This definition here mixes "end-to-end transparency" issues with
  the "end-to-end argument in systems design" (the Saltzer, Reed, Clark
  paper). I think it is indeed
  clearer to separate the two (see also
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2775 and
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4924).
  IMHO the statement "Functionality should be expanded at the end-points to
  ensure that the network interconnects rather than controls."
  is somewhat confusing and doesn't reflect the end-to-end argument:
  Application-specific functions should not be embedded into the
  network and thus stay at the end-points: in many cases, esp.
  when dealing with failures, the right decisions can only
  be made with the corresponding application-specific knowledge,
  which is available there. So the quoted statement is too general
  (just speaks of functionality), the meaning of "expand" is unclear
  and some control functions (e.g., routing) are even necessary for
  providing the interconnection between networks. Consequences
  of the end-to-end argument are robustness and (easier) innovation
  at the edges.

- I don't understand the point of the following text
  "For example, end-to-end instant message encryption would conceal
  communications from one user's instant messaging application..."
  in this context. From the Internet layer perspective encryption
  between an instant messaging client and an intermediate server
  using TLS is end-to-end. From the application layer
  perspective, it is not really end-to-end (user-to-user) encrypted.
  Moreover, in many cases only content can be protected end-to-end
  while some meta-data (mostly in form of protocol headers) need to
  be processed by intermediate nodes.

Integrity: the used definition references RFC 4949 again, but isn't
  taken from there. Please use the one from 4949:
  data integrity:
  "The property that data has not been changed, destroyed, or
   lost in an unauthorized or accidental manner."

Internet censorship: while correctly cited from [Elahi],
the definition is somewhat imprecise, since there is
definitely information available in the Internet at
some servers that is access controlled etc. for good reasons,
e.g., in order to prevent its unauthorized disclosure. That
confidential information is also in many cases relevant
for decision making. According to the definition this
"protected confidential information" is censored. The fix is
probably as follows:
 "Internet censorship is the intentional suppression of otherwise
 freely accessible information originating, flowing or stored on
 systems connected to the Internet where that information is
 relevant for decision making to some entity." (based on [Elahi]).

Interoperable: I don't understand what "without any restricted access or
functionality." means here. Restricted access to what?
Moreover, I think that "interoperable" is more a property of
_implementations_ rather than the protocol specification:
usually one checks whether two independent implementations
(originating from the same protocol specification) interoperate with
each other.

"Open Standards Conform": though I'm not a native speaker, I think
it should be "Open Standards Conforming" or "Conforming to Open
Standards". The reference RFC2606 is incorrect, it should be RFC2026?

Openness: not so clear what is meant here. Unrestricted access to
freely accessible hosts or content, i.e., the absence of Internet
censorship? How is it different from accessibility?

Reliable -> Reliability

Scalable -> Scalability
Scalability is usually defined with respect to certain specific
system parameters (e.g., number of end-systems, users, data flows,
routing entries. etc.). Moreover, growth/shrinkage of these
parameters is typically considered by orders of magnitude.

Connectivity:
- This term needs to be sorted into the right order...
- typo enableing -> enabling (several occurrences in the draft).
- I'm not sure, but I think that the distributed/decentralized
  nature of the Internet is also important for connectivity
  (providing alternative choices of access and routes).

Methodology:
-------------
analysis.The results.... => analysis. The results....

3.2.1.1. Mapping protocols and standards related to human rights

Not sure, but either delete "related" or rephrase as "Relating protocols
and standards to human rights".

   "By combining data from the three data sources named above, an
   extensive list of protocols and standards that potentially enable the
   Internet as a tool for freedom of expression and association."

That sentence is missing a verb, e.g., "an extensive list .... was
created" (or rephrase accordingly to avoid passive voice...).



3.2.1.2. Extracting concepts from mapped RFCs

"mapped RFCs" sounds IMHO a bit odd, maybe replace with "selected RFCs".

   Mapping the protocols and standards that are related to human rights
   and create a human rights enabeling environment was the first step.

Suggestion:

  Identifying the protocols and standards that are related to human
  rights and create a human rights enabling environment was the first
  step.

   The previous steps allowed for the clarification of relations between

This section and the following use many different terms, probably for
the same item: technical definition(s), technical concept(s), technical
term(s) and figure 1 finally uses "architectural principles".

   "allowing for the creation of a list
   of technical concepts that when combined create an enabling"
=>
   "allowing for the creation of a list
   of technical concepts that, when combined, create an enabling"

It is unclear whether one needs to combine _all_ of the technical
concepts or only some of them. Moreover, do we have a "proof" that
this is really the case? The text in 3.2.2 suggests that we probably
have merely hints for the mappings rather than actual evidences or
a very deep understanding of the exact relations between the
technical concepts and human rights.
So I suggest to weaken the statement a bit:
"allowing for the creation of a list of technical concepts that, when
partially combined, _can_ create an enabling"
the same applies to 3.2.1.5. and its title, which is basically a repetition.

figure 1:
it appears to me as if some of the terms are more (system)
properties (the figure mentions characteristics) rather than principles.
We may have/know principles that lead to the mentioned
properties if applied during design, deployment or operation.
Examples:
- Simplicity. Applying minimality principles (KISS or also
the end-to-end argument) may result in simpler systems that eventually
lead to higher robustness (rfc3439 discusses this in more depth).
- Resilience. Every principle that increases robustness may lead
  to higher resilience, e.g., fate-sharing/statelessness,
  end-to-end principle, soft-states, Postel principle, decentralized
  design, etc.

Transparency -> this is missing in the vocabulary. Since transparency
is actually used in very different meanings (transparent=verifiable,
traceable, comprehensible and sometimes even invisible) a clarification
would be good.

Heterogeneity -> Heterogeneity support

figure 2:
- the left column lists not only technical concepts but also (desired)
properties.
- the rationale why the specific rights are impacted by the technical
  concepts or properties are the most interesting part and actually
  missing in the description. It would be very valuable to provide a
  paragraph for each row in section 3.2.2 that explains why there is
  a relation between the concepts/properties and the particular rights.
  For example for the first row: "Connectivity is required, because
  the individual that wants to provide information for others needs
  means to reach potential recipients. Privacy is helpful in case ..."
  Section 4 seems to partially contain some of the reasoning, however,
  I think that it would be better to move it here.

- typo in caption: excise -> exercise

3.2.3.
   The goal here is to
   show, with actual examples, that the design of protocols have
   practical consequences for some human rights and these consequences
   have to be considered at design time.
=> The goal here is to
   show, with actual examples, that the design of protocols have

   should be considered at the design time already.

"have to be" is IMHO too strong.

I'm not sure what meant here by "policy shaping", but probably
policy-based traffic shaping is meant as recently described in
http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2934873 (freely accessible via
http://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2016/program.php). Thus,
probably rephrase as:

no 4.2 or
4.1.2 etc.

   analysis that can serve as the basis for discussion on whether the
   protocol adequately protects against specific human rights threats.

maybe add text that it may stimulate authors to think about alternative
designs choices..

The following sections also do not always contain a rationale
why certain listed human rights are potentially affected adversely.


4.1.1.1.1 Connectivity

I'm really not convinced that the end-to-end argument directly
relates to connectivity rather than to permissionless innovation,
resilience and robustness...

the example of end-to-end encryption would be more suitable for
Privacy and doesn't cover the problem of nevertheless visibile metadata.

For connectivity I would also expect the
right to access to be listed as potentially impacted
(without proper connectivity, certain freely available
information cannot be accessed).

4.1.1.1.3.
Typo: priotization => prioritization

4.1.1.1.4.
=> What about a right to security?

4.1.1.1.5.
   -  Right to political participation

is listed twice

4.1.1.1.7.  Open Standards

Typo:
The Internet was able to developed
=>

4.1.1.1.8.

Typos:
   to allow open innovation possibly have security and privacy
   ramifications, and if so,how can these be dealt with?
=>
   allow open innovation possibly have security and privacy
   ramifications, and if so, how can these be dealt with?

I don't understand how this related to the "right to security"
while I'm missing the
right to access or participation

4.1.1.1.9

   to achieve, it is non-binary concept.  Making pervasive monitoring
=>

4.1.1.1.10

=>
   generate or process anything that can be, or be tightly correlated

4.1.1.1.11
  "Could your protocol also be developed in a stateless manner?"

I don't understand how this would improve accessibility...

4.1.1.1.12
the difference to internationalization is not that clear to me...

4.1.1.1.13
I'm missing the Right to access (a decentralized architecture allows
probably more points of access to the network).

4.1.1.1.14
This could make use of statelessness and soft-states as technical principles

Why is only the right to security listed here? Right to access would
also fit here...


4.1.1.1.15

what about the right to privacy?

4.1.1.1.16

   Question(s): Does your protocol maintain and assure the accuracy of
   data?  Does your protocol maintain and assure the consistency of
   data?  Does your protocol in any way allow for the data to be
   (intentionally or unintentionally) altered?

I think these are flawed (cf. also my criticism on the definition
in the vocabulary). Especially, "Does your protocol in any way allow for
the data to be
(intentionally or unintentionally) altered?" doesn't make much sense to me.
I suppose that the question consideres alteration while data is in transit.
Which data is meant here? Protocol control information, i.e. headers,
usually needs to be altered in transit, whereas payload data probably
shouldn't be modified. Normally, protocols cannot really
"prevent" that data is modified in transit, but they can have measures
to detect
any unauthorized modification.

This impacts also the right to freedom of expression since
censoring measure can lead to unauthorized modification of
data.

4.1.1.1.17.

Impacts several other rights, e.g., right to privacy, right to freedom
of expression etc. because in some cases that origin can be clearly
identified which discloses information sources.

4.1.1.1.18.
Adaptability is closely interrelated permissionless
=>
Adaptability is closely interrelated to permissionless

----
so much for now...

Hi,

As Jan 9 has come and gone the last call is ended.=20

I am still digesting the responses, but from my first reading, do
believe we got significant and substantive comment.

I know of at least one review, from one of the IETF General Area
reviewers, that is still being worked on and would like to be able to
accept it as part of the Last Call comments, assuming it shows up  in
the next few days.  Are they any other pending reviews in progress?

thanks

avri

There is a good reason to not treat all human rights alike. Some are
already well-covered in IETF work (such as privacy in RFC 6973). I
think we should focus on rights which have not been, until recently,
explicitely discussed in the IETF (such as freedom of expression).

> define "human rights" there

I think it is not up to the IETF/IRTF to define human rights and we
should defer to an external definition (the draft currently uses the
UDHR, which I think is a good idea). May be a sentence in the
terminology section like "Human rights: the rights of every human
being, as defined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights [Ref]"?

I suggest to follow the classical rule: when it is between quotes, it
is a litteral statement. Otherwise, it can be a summary or a
synthesis.

Here, there are in the draft no quotes around the sentence you
mention, meaning clearly that it was not supposed to be an exact
citation.

Agreed. Authenticity without integrity is almost useless.

No. If a system deletes my *private* messages (content which was not
"freely accessible information"), it is still censorship.

I disagree. The goal of the section is certainly not to focus on
negative examples.

I personnally think it would be a welcome addition to add posituve
examples but I asked for some and nobody suggested anything (besides
the very general "IP is efficient, it works, and it allows a wonderful
thing, the Internet"). May be we should search harder?

I think it is two different things. "Filtering can be made apparent by
the use of status code 451" is an answer to the question "Does your
protocol make it apparent or transparent when filtering happens?" and
"Identifiers of content exposed within a protocol might be used to
facilitate censorship" is an answer to the question "Does this
protocol introduce new identifiers or reuse existing identifiers (e.g.
MAC addresses) that might be associated with persons or content?"

I tend to have a pragmatic vision here. We can discuss for a long time
between "Everything is political" and "Nothing in the RFC is
political" but the current state at the IETF is that, IMHO, most
protocol authors and RFC authors _underestimate_ the political
consequences of their choices. So, it is a good idea to err on the
side of "there are more things political than you think".

There is may be a risk that some people will take the "protocols are
politics by other means" too seriously and will find political
consequences in the fact that the source IP address is before the
destination IP address, but such a risk is probably very low, and it
won't be a practical problem in the IETF.

I tend to agree with what you say and would also be ok with
a statement like that being in the draft.

I don't think that'd be the problem but rather that if we
embraced that (IMO plain incorrect) statement we'd risk
ending up damaging our concept that good technical argument
is what wins. While the IETF is nowhere near perfect in
that regard, it seems to me far less imperfect than most
other similar bodies and we ought be careful to not damage
that.

Cheers,
S.

PS: All that said, I remain ok with what I think was the
last version of the text Niels posted to the list.

Hi,

I agree with that.

Also that.

The above is almost certainly the crux of where we disagree, and maybe
why I'm a little grouchy about this.

Having just spent at least the last two years playing Junior
Achievement Internet Politician, I can report that there is an entire
world of people who seem genuinely to believe that this is all just
politics, and that what is really needed is for some grownup
politicians to come along and tell the IETF how it should make
protocols.  Those are people who think that a single root in a
hierachical namespace is a mere political decision, rather than a fact
of math.  Those are people who think that, with the application of
enough political oversight, key escrow is a perfectly good idea for
the world rather than a giant security vulnerability waiting to be
exploited.  And those are people who think that internetwork-style
connectivity as opposed to a dramatically more centralized style is
_simply_ a political question, rather than one that has technical
follow-on consequences with their own technical implications.

There is a limnable difference between "technical decision that has
consequences for politics" and "simply a political question".  I think
we need to be careful about that, both for political reasons (what it
might drag us into) and technical reasons (what it might make possible
or impossible).

Best regards,

A

I agree with what Andrew says below, but am less grouchy having
managed to avoid almost all of that particular nonsense;-)

I think I also noted, however, that the interpretation offered was
considerably broader than the text in 1958 would justify if the latter
were read strictly.  This has not been fixed in the latest version I
checked in github.

It's interesting how the definition of "internet" (even discounting
big "I" vs little "i") has evolved over the years.

Early on it was mostly used to describe a network which used different
media in a reasonably transparent way. Today that might be wi-fi and
ethernet.

35+ years ago media tended to define a network if for no other reason
than the media or its usage within a network was usually proprietary.

Not much later the idea that it could tie together networks with
otherwise incompatible protocols such as NCP, DECNET, UUCP, SNA,
BITNET, Netware, CHAOSnet, etc became very popular much like the
concurrent idea that higher-level programming languages could produce
code for very different architectures, and even operating systems
(Unix-like) became largely architecture-independent.

So the "internet" largely focused on either gatways which for example
moved email or other services between these otherwise incompatible
networks, or the beginnings of what we'd call today virtual networks
which could carry otherwise incompatible protocols typically for
long-distance haul (e.g., UUCP over TCP/IP.)

As media compatability became taken for granted and most of the other
network protocols faded into obscurity the concept began to move to a
more political and administrative meaning -- that the internet tied
together separately administered but technically mostly identical
networks.

[THE POINT]

So one can quote a platitude such as the above but what the words
actually were intended to mean tends to be embedded in either its own
ancient or some current historical context.

Agreed, but this wasn't my point. I think that some human rights
aren't listed which should be there, I gave hints for section 4
with respect to that. However, since the rationale is missing,
it's unclear why some are there, but others which hare related
IMHO aren't listed.

Yes, that was what I meant, since there are several definitions out
there and it's unclear which ones are used within the draft. It should
also include a list of HRs which are considered within the draft. That
would make it clearer to read the draft without checking the original
definitions.

Yep, but in this case it's neither literally nor as synthesis contained.

Yes, but I tried to explain that I wasn't able to extract this statement
- even as summary - out of RFC 1958 and that's IMHO really
misleading. Otherwise, I'd really like to see a more specific pointer
to the content where that statement was derived from...

Yes, that's probably correct, so my proposal to fix it doesn't seem to
work :-)
However, I'm not sure that a firewall that is used to protect business
secrets is really "Internet censorship" and that was my point of the
more general statement.

 Roland

That is pretty clearly addressed and outlined in section 3.2.2, right?

I think this is a good suggestion, so I cut the first sentence into two
and changed the order of thing. The abstract reads now:

This document aims to propose guidelines for human rights
considerations, similar to the work done on the guidelines for privacy
considerations {{RFC6973}}. This is achieved by providing a proposal for
a vocabulary to discuss the relation between human rights and Internet
protocols, an overview of the discussion in technical and academic
literature and communities, a proposal for the mapping of the relation
between human rights and technical concepts, as well as guidelines.



If you want to see how to apply this work to your own, you can directly
go to <xref
target=3D"model-for-developing-human-rights-protocol-considerations" />.
The rest of the document explains the background of the guidelines and
how they were developed.

That's what the first paragraph of the introduction does imho.

I drafted this:

Human rights
: Human rights are principles and norms that are indivisible,
interrelated, unalienable, universal, and mutually reinforcing that have
been codified in national and international bodies of law. The Universal
Declaration of Human Rights {{UDHR}} is the most well-known document in
the history of human rights. The apirations from this documents were
later codified into treaties such as the {{ICCPR}} and the {{ICESCR}},
after which signatory countries were obliged to reflect them in their
national bodies of law. There is also a broad recognition that not only
states have an obligations vis a vis human rights, but non-state actors
do so as well.

>=20

I think this is addressed in section 4.1.1:

Note that the guidance provided in this section does not recommend
specific practices. The range of protocols developed in the IETF is too
broad to make recommendations about particular uses of data or how human
rights might be balanced against other design goals.  However, by
carefully considering the answers to the following questions, document
authors should be able to produce a comprehensive analysis that can
serve as the basis for discussion on whether the protocol adequately
protects against specific human rights threats. This guidance is meant
to help the thought process of a human rights analysis; it does not
provide specific directions for how to write a human rights protocol
considerations section (following the example set in {{RFC6973}}), and
the addition of a human rights protocol considerations section has also
not yet been proposed.

Changed the typo. Used your suggested language (application-specific
functions... application specific knowledge) in the introduction. For
the second half, clarified that we are referring to the end-to-end
argument as laid out in saltzer et. al. and mentioned that further
aspects of end-to-end connectivity can be found in RFC 2775.

Changed text became:

One of the key architectural guidelines of the Internet is the
end-to-end principle. The argument in favor of the end-to-end approach
to system design is laid out in the fundamental paper by Saltzer, Reed,
and Clark {{Saltzer}} {{Clark}}. In it, the authors argue in favor of
radical simplification:  systems designers should only build the
essential and shared functions into the network, as most functions can
only be implemented at network end points. Building features into the
network for the benefit of certain applications, will come at the
expense of others. As such, as a general system designers should attempt
to steer clear of building anything into the network that is not a bare
necessity for its functioning. Following the end-to-end principle is
crucial for innovation, as it makes innovation at the edges possible
without having to make changes to the network, and the robustness of the
network.

Fair point. Changed into:

: A property of a documented standard or protocol which allows different
independent implementations to work with each other without any
restriction on functionality.

Made it:

Scalability

: The ability to handle increased or decreased system parameters (e.g.,
number of end-systems, users, data flows, routing entries. etc.)
predictably within defined expectations. There should be a clear
definition of its scope and applicability. The limits of a systems
scalability should be defined. Growth or shrinkage of these parameters
is typically considered by orders of magnitude.

I made the text into this:

On the basis of this list a number of technical concepts that appeared
frequently was extracted, and used to create a second list of technical
terms that, when combined and applied in different circumstances, create
an enabling environment for excercising human rights on the Internet.

They need to be applied in different ways, in different cases. There is
no homogeneous implementation regime in all protocols and
implementations. It is a case by case basis, based on universal principle=
s.

I started writing on a lemma for transparency and pretty soon indeed got
in quite some trouble. As you clearly indicated transparency can mean
quite a few different things, often also the exact opposite:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_%28human%E2%80%93computer_inte=
raction%29

So instead of writing three paragraphs about all possible definitions of
transparency I'd like to offer this:

Transparency
: In this context transparency is linked to the comprehensibility of a
protocol in relation to the choices it makes for both user and protocol
developers and implementers.

>=20

whereas I agree it would be interesting to do this, I think it would
also easily add twenty pages to the draft, which I think would not
necessarily add much to the usability and readability of the draft.
Furthermore, we will need to do more research to create a more
exhaustive list. So I will defintely put this on the to do list of the
group. We are actually exactly trying this with the new Anonymity draft.

The goal here is to show, with actual examples, that the design of

What do you mean with the right to access? The right to political

I don't think the UDHR needs IETF consensus.

The IETF is indeed a private entity.

I am not sure what the consequences of a conclusion on this would be. As
said, we have been aiming to get quite a lot of input on this draft, and
we had reviewers and contributors from different continents.

It would be great if you could help us find a reviewer from Africa. Then
we would have reviewers from all continents.

I agree, but not all scripts are serviced by UTF-8, that is the reason
for this addition, so if someone uses something else, it should be
properly tagged.

I think the definition follows the one of Adam Thiere, and he does not
solely aim at governments as you indicate between square brackets.

If an IETF decision is not understandable, that is a problem.

I think there are a lot of contentious discussion in the IETF, else we
would not have as many discussions. They are exactly about encryption,
privacy, etc, as the topics that are covered in the book you refer to.

?

Cheers,

PS It would be great if you could leave the thread intact so the
discussion is easier for people to follow (and to respond to).

Added:

### Map cases of protocols, implementations and networking paradigms
that adversely impact human rights or are enablers thereof


Given the information above, the following list of cases of protocols,
implenentations and networking paradigms that adversely impact or enable
human rights was formed.

Added some text:

It is important to note that the assessment here is not a general

potential negative or positive impacts on human rights they might have.

Am trying to understand this better. If a questions says:

Did you have a look at the Privacy Considerations for Internet Protocols
{{RFC6973}}, especially section 6.1.1 ?

or:

Did you have a look at Guidelines for Writing RFC Text on Security
Considerations {{BCP72}}? Have you found any attacks that are out of
scope for your protocol? Would these attacks be pertinent to the human
rights enabling features of the Internet (as described throughout this
document)?

I don't not necessarily understand how this could be confusing.

But to resolve this I would like to offer:

This section provides guidance for document authors in the form of a
questionnaire about protocols and their (potential) impact. The
questionnaire may be useful at any point in the design process,
particularly after document authors have developed a high-level protocol
model as described in {{RFC4101}}. These guidelines do not seek to
replace any existing referenced specifications, but rather contribute to
them and look at the design process from a human rights perspective.

You're right, we replaced the end-to-end example to a middle-box example.=

Exactly the other way around.

>=20

I never thought payload like that, not sure if that is very colloquial
use. What term could we use to describe the non-header part of a packet?
Data portion?

Would this work better:

If your protocol impacts packet handling, does it use user data (packet
data that is not included in the header)? Is it making decisions based
on the payload of the packet? Does your protocol prioritize certain
content or services over others in the routing process ? Is the protocol
transparent about the prioritization that is made (if any)?

It's more of an impact example than a specific protocol example.

>=20

Using an identifier doesn't mean state is being kept, but no state can
be kept without using an identifier.

If state identifiers are used this can have a negative effect on
anonymity, especially if these are also re-used in other protocols, and
thereby creating a more persistent identifier.

This does not mean that every identifier will have that effect.

I think RFC4941 and RFC7217 could be a good example of this.

Added:

In the development of the IPv6 protocol it was discussed to embed a
Media Access Control (MAC) address into unique IP addresses. This would
make it possible for 'eavesdroppers and other information collectors to
identify when different addresses used in different transactions
actually correspond to the same node. {{RFC4941}} This is why Privacy
Extensions for Stateless Address Autoconfiguration in IPv6 have been
introduced. {{RFC4941}}

I've added:

Do you normatively reference another standard that is not available
without cost (and could it possible be done without)?

[...]

All standards that need to be normatively implemented should be freely
available and with reasonable protection for patent infringement claims,
so it can also be implemented in open source or free software. Patents
have often held back open standardization or been used against those
deploying open standards, particularly in the domain of cryptography
{{newegg}}. An exemption of this is sometimes made when a protocol is
standardized that normatively relies  on speficiations produced by
others SDOs that are not freely available.

I've added the 'Accessibility' in relation to connectivity to the header
'Connectivity', and kept 'Accessibility' in relation to the design of
protocols, services or implementation that provide an enabling
environment for people with disabilities.

Following up on Roland Bless' note, and as last call has closed, I wish
to raise a concern about repeated discussion about the selection of
rights that has been discussed in the draft.  The interplay between
different human rights and the impact of that interplay on this
interdisciplinary work requires that there be some reasonable level of
cross-disciplinary review, and yet unfortunately that has not happened.=20
The one review we do have from someone clearly working within political
science disputes the premise of the work and concludes that the draft be
completely rewritten.[1][*]  This wouldn't matter that much for an
individual submission.  However, that's not the current intended trajecto=
ry.

I suggest the chairs seek broader review from additional people with
subject matter expertise re human rights, political science, and / or
international relations.  Absent that level of review neither this group
nor the IRSG are competent to assess the political / human rights
aspects of the draft, and the draft should not proceed.  We don't go to
network nerds for medical advice; neither should we rely on ourselves
for the human rights / political aspects of the draft.

Eliot

[1] Jeanette Hofmann, 7 Jan 2017

[*] This is not to say there aren't learned people in this discussion.=20
I count no fewer than five PhDs engaged, and several otherwise
knowledgeable people.

I strongly disagree with this line of reasoning. It seems common (the
famous New Yorker
cartoon... <https://twitter.com/WillMcPhail/status/815899174474567680/>)
but it is nevertheless wrong. Politics is special because it comes
from the citizens, not from experts (or not just from experts). It is
quite different from medecine (or computer networking...), where
things are right or wrong, and people can learn the difference.

If having studied political science would make you better at judging
issues around human rights, then we could shutdown democracy (not just
the current instances, but any idea of democracry as well) and replace
it by a governement of PhDs in political sciences. But, in the current
state of science, it is not true.

Stephane,

There is a difference between participation in politics and research
into the discipline.  This is the Internet RESEARCH Task Force, not the
Internet POLITCAL PARTICIPATION Task Force (although I'll grant it feels
like that sometimes).  If the document does proceed without the academic
review, then let us at least be honest with ourselves that it is a
political work and not a work of research.

Eliot

May I suggest that this document has been reviewed by academics? For
instance Molly Sauter, Harry Halpin, Roland Bless, Nathalie Marechal,
Scott Craig are all academics as well as Stephen Farrell.

Furthermore, I've replied to Roland where he brought this up and offered
a solution to that specific issue.

I also do not think that conflating all issues to one (and not taking
the discussion and solutions into account) and therefore dismissing the
draft is not really fair imho.

Best,

Niels (with his author hat on)

Niels,

You are missing my point.  What I asked for was additional review from
people in the other disciplines be sought.  Nowhere did I suggest that
the draft be thrown away, nor would I (that was Jeanette Hofmann, by the
way, who wrote that on the 7th of January).  For one thing, on the
precise interplay I mention, I myself do not feel qualified to go much
further but to note that it is there.  Second, of the people you mention
many are computer scientists.  Also, of the people you mentioned there
is no record of the review of some of them.  I think it's fine that you
got review from them, but if this is to be a consensus document, perhaps
you would share those?

Eliot

draft is not really fair imho.

Best,

There is a difference between participation in politics and research
into the discipline.  This is the Internet RESEARCH Task Force, not the
Internet POLITCAL PARTICIPATION Task Force (although I'll grant it feels
like that sometimes).  If the document does proceed without the academic
review, then let us at least be honest with ourselves that it is a
political work and not a work of research.

but it is nevertheless wrong. Politics is special because it comes
from the citizens, not from experts (or not just from experts). It is
quite different from medecine (or computer networking...), where
things are right or wrong, and people can learn the difference.

If having studied political science would make you better at judging
issues around human rights, then we could shutdown democracy (not just
the current instances, but any idea of democracry as well) and replace
it by a governement of PhDs in political sciences. But, in the current
state of science, it is not true.

Hi Eliot,

I agree that interdisciplinary work is required, but people
from social sciences alone won't fix it. Interdisciplinary work
is usually hard, because we (as mostly technical people) need to
understand the viewpoints / perspectives of the other disciplines
(e.g., social sciences, legal sciences, ethics etc.) and vice versa.
That starts with a common understanding of certain terms and probably
ends up in finding out methods how to consider human rights impacts
in protocol design. So the main point of this draft and RG is to
raise awareness on issues related to HR impact. This indeed needs
more discussion between the disciplines.

Moreover, protocol specifications are only a small part of the
story. I think that a large part has to do with operational and
administrative practices and entities: especially authorities who manage
addresses and namespaces exert power in certain ways, e.g.,
affecting the right to access, right to participate, the right to
freedom of assembly and expression. In some cases authorization
may be enforced by technical means (e.g., building access control
into the network), in other cases merely by operational
means (e.g., being the administrative entity who owns and operates the
corresponding server). The IETF covers operational issues to some
extent, while others are left to the market. The mentioned impacts
by operations would largely fall into the institutionalization domain.
This should also be discussed a bit in the draft, however, IMHO it is ok
to firstly concentrate on protocol design and protocol mechanism issues.

Regards,
 Roland

It was always sort of strange to me that we were trying to make this a
consensus document anyway.  It's an IRTF product, and the IRTF need
not work by consensus.  It's also a research document.

Maybe the problem is that we're trying to hit the wrong goal.  I think
the document has been widely reviewed.  I think there are some known
issues that some have with it; I've made several suggestions not all
of which have been IMO incorporated, but I think the authors are in a
position to do make that call.

If this were an IETF document, I think it would be in trouble because
the rough seems large and multifaceted.  But for a research document,
there's nothing wrong with that outcome normally.  Why is this case
special?

I apologize for that.  I sent a subscription request last year 
through https://www.irtf.org/mailman/listinfo/hrpc  I assumed that 
the research group might be a closed group as I did not receive an 
email confirmation.  For what it is worth, the threading should work 
correctly for this reply.

>I don't think the UDHR needs IETF consensus.

I'll comment about the UDHR below.

>I don't think the mission would be at odds with that.

The following may turn into an issue then: 
https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/hrpc/current/msg00801.html

>I do not know.

If I recall correctly, I provided a reference to show that there are 
at least a few participants who are uncomfortable to discuss about 
"non-technical" topics.  I have met attendees who reside in what some 
people might view as "difficult" countries.

>If you have an posiyion about this it would be great to hear your arguments.

I would describe "censorship resistance" as a public policy issue if 
I were to write to the regulator about it.  I usually avoid 
discussing such matters outside the national context.

>The IETF is indeed a private entity.

There are some recommendations at

Page 9 states that "technical and design choices can have a 
substantial impact on freedom of expression".  I could not find any 
statement about the UDHR or any other right in respect to technical standards.

>Not sure what is meant by this.

I was asking about whether it would be the responsibility of the 
companies or NGOs participating in the IETF to make human 
rights-oriented contributions to technical discussions.

>I am not sure what the consequences of a conclusion on this would be. As
>said, we have been aiming to get quite a lot of input on this draft, and
>we had reviewers and contributors from different continents.

In the absence of statistics it is not possible to verify whether the 
above is actually correct.  I took a quick look at the mailing list 
archive and I could not find any review from, for example, South 
America.  I could not find any review from, for example, a country 
from Asia from which a significant number of IETF attendees come 
from.  It may raise questions about the conclusion has some bias.

>It would be great if you could help us find a reviewer from Africa. Then
>we would have reviewers from all continents.

I doubt that one reviewer would be representative of that 
continent.  There is an "IETF Africa" mailing list.  I am not sure 
whether it would help you find a reviewer; still, it may be worth a try.

>What IETF body do you mean? And what has that to do with a text on an
>external website?

I don't think that a statement to a UN Office has the same weight as 
one sent to an external website.  I would have to ask questions to 
find out which IETF body is responsible for such issues.

>I agree, but not all scripts are serviced by UTF-8, that is the reason
>for this addition, so if someone uses something else, it should be
>properly tagged.

Could the research group please provide an example of a script which 
is not serviced by UTF-8?

It is not that easy to reply on tagging as there are cases where the 
tagging would fail in practice.

>The reference is not to an open standard.

Ok.

>I think the definition follows the one of Adam Thiere, and he does not

>https://www.cato.org/publications/cato-online-forum/embracing-culture-permissionless-innovation

I read that part of the book again.  If the approval of a government 
entity was not required, which other entity which is not considered 
as "government" would give such approval?

The reference provided above is one related to "Strategy for American 
Innovation".  There is the following point: "Unless a compelling case 
can be made that a new invention or business model will bring serious 
harm to individuals, innovation should be allowed to continue 
unabated and problems, if they develop at all, can be addressed 
later".  That could be read as meaning that human rights 
considerations should be addressed later when there is evidence that 
there has been a compelling case of serious harm.

Yes.

>No, that was also not what I claimed at any time.

Ok.

Just my two cents here, especially as the silent college of international
human rights lawyers-scholars was called upon in an earlier mail:

As the "Ruggie Principles
<https://business-humanrights.org/en/un-secretary-generals-special-represen=
tative-on-business-human-rights/un-protect-respect-and-remedy-framework-and=
-guiding-principles>"
(the UN "Protect, Respect and Remedy" Framework) cofirm, Internet companies
must in all their actions respect the internationally recognised human
rights and fundamental freedoms of their users and of non-users who are
affected by their activities. The responsibility to respect human rights
exists independently of the States=E2=80=99 ability or willingness to fulfi=
ll their
own human rights obligations. The same applies arguably to non-governmental
actors. Therefore the answer would be: yes, companies and company
representatives (and anyone really) involved in standardization in any form
must respect human rights.

Though interpretations of the concrete duties flowing from this duty of
respect may differ, the duty itself isn't really controversial anymore.

See, e.g., the Principles of the Telecommunications Industry Dialogue
<https://www.telecomindustrydialogue.org/about/guiding-principles/>

"The UN =E2=80=98Protect, Respect, and Remedy=E2=80=99 framework defines it=
 as; 1. the
state=C2=B4s duty to protect human rights, and 2. the corporate responsibil=
ity
to respect human rights.iii =E2=80=A2 The ICCPR recognises that the rights =
to
freedom of expression and privacy can only be restricted in limited
circumstances.iv =E2=80=A2 The OECD framework states that =E2=80=9C[a] Stat=
e=E2=80=99s failure
either to enforce relevant domestic laws, or to implement international
human rights obligations or the fact that it may act contrary to such laws
or international obligations does not diminish the expectation that
enterprises respect human rights."

We find a similar approach in the Global Network Initiative's Principles
<https://globalnetworkinitiative.org/principles/index.php>:

"The duty of governments to respect, protect, promote and fulfill human
rights is the foundation of this human rights framework. That duty includes
ensuring that national laws, regulations and policies are consistent with
international human rights laws and standards on freedom of expression and
privacy.

Information and Communications Technology (ICT) companies have the
responsibility to respect and protect the freedom of expression and privacy
rights of their users. ICT has the potential to enable the exchange of
ideas and access to information in a way that supports economic
opportunity, advances knowledge and improves quality of life."

In implementing the duty to respect, companies have to prepare, inter
alia, human
rights impact assessment and ensure that HR-sensitive due diligence
processes are implemented at all stages of business.

If I understand this laudable effort here correctly, setting standards for
an HR impact assessment in standardization processes is exactly its
(important) aim.

Kind regards

Matthias

Andrew,

I too find it strange to aim for consensus, mostly because truth doesn't
rest on such a political concept.  Be that as it may, I'm not seeking
perfection, either in the process or the work.  Still, it's best to know
that there are those who understand and agree (or at least do not
object) to the usage of such references as [UDHR], [Cath], [Jabri],
[Schroeder], and [King] in the same way that you would assess reference
to [RFC1958].

That was a reference to the IETF 100 discussion, I think that was quite
a different context. That was also the email of one person.

I think the draft also shows the relation to technical topics, if it had
nothing to do with technology or protocols it would indeed not belong her=

Would you say the same about pervasive monitoring?

The right to freedom of expression is article 19 of the UDHR.

See the e-mail of Matthias Ketteman about this, as well as the report of
the UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Exporession I referred to earlier=

I am happy to name more people (you've also seen several in the film),
but it still actually a precondition to any document in the IRTF or IETF
? I think this is something we actually address; more diversity is
needed. But that should not bar us from doing work now, because that
would not solve the issue either.

Thiere talks about needing no permission from social norms,
institutions, companies as well as governments to innovate. Not solely
governments.

I think what we're doing here is not throw up a barrier, exactly the
opposite, ensure that the model will not be hampered by external
barriers (governments), because we have thought of a way to respect
human rights ourselves. Else other parties might come in and do it for
us, if we don't take our responsibility.

I am sorry to hear that, I would be happy to review specific issues
again to see if we can come to compromise. I thought we had already come
to that point.

I was under the impression we were doing quite OK with addressing issues
and finding solutions. Luckily I will not need to be the judge of that.

But if people want to point out issues I am more than eager to work
finding solution for consensus with you all.

Best,

Niels (with author hat on)

I've pointed out recently, for instance, a case where we deeply
disagree about the interpretation of RFC 1958.  It's your research
publication, so you get to say what you want, though, and therefore I
don't think it appropriate to press any more on it.

I think the RG appears to be converging on things in a way that the RG
can live with and that would be appropriate for an IRTF RG to publish.
My comments, at least, have all been with the filter that this is an
IRTF RG document and that ultimately it cannot govern IETF work.  I
think the questions that people might ask themselves are potentially
useful, and a way to learn about their utility is to publish a
document and then see what people do with it.  

Best regards,

A

No, that paragraph is really fine (except for that "proportional way"),
my point was that the rest of the document has more a tone of "translate
this human right to a technical concept and make sure that
this concept is used in order to enable the human right." and seems
to suggest enforcing or enabling human rights by building certain
mechanisms into protocols. This is different from trying to achieve
awareness for impacts on human rights. So maybe it is easy to fix by
rephrasing certain passages in the text, e.g.,
"List technical terms that combined create enabling environment
for human rights", "Translating human rights to technical terms",
"on whether the protocol adequately protects against specific human
rights threats." (maybe the protocol doesn't need a built-in
protection, but operational aspects need to be regulated, e.g.,
namespace assignment etc.).

That is basically fine, but as pointed out above the rest of the draft
reads more like suggesting to built-in HR enabling mechanisms or at
least to support those.

It think that this statement here:
>    This will ensure
>    that the impact protocols can have on human rights is clear and
>    explicit, both for developers and for users.

is a little bit too strong. Even if one has read the document the impact
isn't always _clear_ and explicit. So IMHO the aim is to show that there
_is_ an impact that one should consider, however, in some cases it may
remain quite unclear how strong the impact is etc.

I'll check with Carsten and propose a text.

HI Andrew, Niels, all,

Although I wholly agree with you on process and the status of this work =
as research paper produced by IRTF. We might have to be careful on how =

straight away answer on how to fix this. But for people who are less =

quoting from it in non-scientific publications, a headline =E2=80=9CThe =
IETF recently=E2=80=A6.=E2=80=9D is quickly written :(

Again, process wise we are totally on the right track here, but it might =
be worth to at least think about the possible side effects, also because =
this topic is so broad and has a lot of interest from groups outside the =
technical community.

Hi Niels,
At 15:46 18-01-2017, Niels ten Oever wrote:
>Why?

There are different perspectives to the discussions about "technical 
standards".  The one on which the draft is based is that "the 
mission" is about an entity (or entities) gaining an economic or 
political advantage.  It will be problematic for the IETF if that is 
its mission.

>Would you say the same about pervasive monitoring?

That is an interesting question.  I might review a draft, e.g. 
https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/ietf/current/msg96446.html  Is 
that anything in that review which is a political or public policy question?

>See the e-mail of Matthias Ketteman about this, as well as the report of

I read the substantive comments from Dr Ketteman and I found them informative.

>[person name removed]

There is a mailing list archive at 
https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/hrpc/current/maillist.html  I 
could not find any review from that person.  A quick verification 
shows that the person resides in The Netherlands.  According to an 
overview published by the European Union, the Netherlands is not a 
country located in South America ( 
https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/countries/member-countries/netherlands_en 
).

My preference is to be provided with URLs to reviews from those 
persons if the draft is to be based on reviews instead of 
endorsements.  The document discusses about society, the right to 
non-discrimination, the right to political participation, etc. and 
yet it did not gather any views from the other side of the 
equator.  IRTF or IETF documents, in general, do not discuss about 
human rights or political participation.

I am not opposed, outside a standards-setting context, to your 
views.  I did commend the two organizations for their efforts ( 
https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/hrpc/current/msg00731.html 
).  Based on the discussions, I am left with a sense that the bar for 
research within this research group is quite low.

>I have already posted there, but thanks for the advice.

That is strange.  I went through the messages from that mailing list 
and I could not find your message.  I doubt that you will find 
reviewers if your message was not delivered by the mailing list.

>You got me confused now. What statement to which UN office?

It is the submission at 
https://www.article19.org/data/files/medialibrary/38604/Submission-to-UNSR---Telecos-and-access-sector-A19-2016.pdf 
I gather that the submission was to the UN Special Rapporteur on the 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression ( 
http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/FreedomOpinion/Pages/CallTelecommunications.aspx 
).

>This point was brought up by Stephane, Stephane could you help out?

I'll wait for Stephane to comment.

>Thiere talks about needing no permission from social norms,

At my location, it is usually government/regulatory roadblocks.  This 
news article is about innovation in a country in Europe: 
https://www.ft.com/content/3d65be7a-2e22-11e6-bf8d-26294ad519fc  I 
don't think that it a protocol consideration.  Permissionless 
innovation does not fit within the end-to-end model which the draft 
uses as a boundary for it discussions about (IETF) protocol considerations.

The external barriers are already there.  People who are not 
residents of that part of the world do not see it or ignore it as it 
is in their interest to do so.  Those barriers are not directly 
related to IETF standardization work.  The interactions related to 
human rights occur at the public policy level.  The model will be 
hampered if an IETF body crosses the line.

S. Moonesamy

Dear S Moonesamy,

Somehow the earlier responses got cut from the mail again, it would be
great if you could leave them intact.

That was not the question. The problem is that many technical choices
have an impact on real life events, we cannot deny or ignore that.

I was not aware that nationality is based on where one resides. But if
that is the case the nationality of authors and contributors is actually
more more diverse.

Firstly, one of the first co-authors of this draft was from Latin
America. There have been many contributions from people all over the
world, and I would not know why this topic would set a higher bar
document process.

If you come to this conclusion, it would be great to understand where
you base this on.

I see my message bounced and the mailinglist is not open, could you

So a independent organization submits something to a UN body, and you

That is not the conclusion of what Dr. Ketteman or the UN Special

Yes.  Some of us (I am actually among them) think that it's been many
years since "the RFC series" was understood as having different
streams, and that we should stop publishing anything except IETF
consensus documents in it (which means no IAB stream, no IRTF stream,
and no independent submissions).  But that's not the rule that we're
living under today, alas, and we'll have to deal with the fallout.

For the alternative consequence of the above observations is basically
just that the RG shouldn't publish an RFC on this topic, period,
because it doesn't have IETF consensus and cannot.  I doubt the RG is
going to accept that conclusion.

Best regards,

A

Hi,

one more comment below.

This is actually not so difficult to solve.
I proposed to list the considered human rights and to provide a
rationale when HR impacts from technical properties/mechanisms are derived.
As a start one could use the same reasoning as in our paper [*]:
"The main source of the values of human rights is the International
Bill of Human Rights that is composed of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights (UDHR) [33] along with the International Covenant on Civil
and Political Rights (ICCPR) [34] and the International Covenant on
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) [35]. In the light of
several cases of Internet censorship, the Human Rights Council
Resolution 20/8 was adopted in 2012, affirming . . . that the same
rights that people have offline must also be protected online. . . 
[36]. In 2015, the Charter of Human Rights and Principles for the
Internet [17] was developed and released [18]. According to these
documents, some examples of human rights relevant for ICT systems are
human dignity (Art. 1 UDHR),
non-discrimination (Art. 2),
rights to life,
liberty and security (Art. 3),
freedom of opinion and expression (Art. 19),
freedom of assembly and association (Art. 20),
rights to equal protection, legal remedy, fair trial, due process,
presumed innocent (Art. 711),
appropriate social and international order (Art. 28),
participation in public affairs (Art. 21),
participation in cultural life,
protection of intellectual property (Art. 27), and
privacy (Art. 12)."

This we already changed into:

enabling environment for human rights


, "Translating human rights to technical terms",

Hi Niels,
At 03:25 19-01-2017, Niels ten Oever wrote:
>Where do you read this in the draft?

The draft starts with a quotation from RFC 3935.  There is a message 
at https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/hrpc/current/msg00794.html 
about "technology performs more than a merely 'technical function'" 
and some discussion over different threads about the link with the IETF.

>That was not the question. The problem is that many technical choices
>have an impact on real life events, we cannot deny or ignore that.

I was asked a question about pervasive surveillance and I provided a 
URL to a review which anyone reading the mailing list can assess for 
himself/herself.  The argument in the above (see quoted paragraph) is 
that "many technical choices have an impact on real life 
events".  The argument is not accompanied by actual cases which are 
directly related to IETF protocols or standards-setting.

>I was not aware that nationality is based on where one resides. But if

It is not about nationality.  In order to know how a person in 
Country X is affected by a decision it is better to ask a person in 
that country as he or she is directly impacted by the laws of that 
country.  I could ask, for example, a person in Europe who is from 
another country (nationality).  Would I get a good view of what is 
actually happening from that input?

To put it differently, would a person living in The Netherlands be 
impacted if HTTP is blocked in, for example, New Zealand?  Would the 
human rights of that person be infringed by that decision?

>Firstly, one of the first co-authors of this draft was from Latin

Human rights can be based on academic literature or it can be a 
matter which a person in a far away country with internet access can 
relate to.  As for the higher bar, I did not argue for the draft to 
be a consensus document. If it is claimed that there are people from 
all over the world reviewing this document, that information should 
be verifiable if this draft is research work.  It might help Afnic in 
its efforts (e.g. 
https://www.afnic.fr/en/about-afnic/news/general-news/9961/show/afnic-reveals-figures-on-diversity-within-icann-1.html 
).

>If you come to this conclusion, it would be great to understand where
>you base this on.

As an example, I asked about UTF8 and I have yet to receive an 
adequate answer.  If the research group had already done a 
significant amount of technical research it should not be too 
difficult to point me to the answer.

>I see my message bounced and the mailinglist is not open, could you
>request my subscription?

I sent an (off-list) email about your subscription and copied it to you.

>So a independent organization submits something to a UN body, and you
>think the IETF should have a say about that? How so?

My answer to the first question is "no".  The independent 
organization has its name on draft-irtf-hrpc-research and one of RG 
Chairs is affiliated with the independent organization.  I asked 
whether the RG Chairs asked the relevant IETF body about that.  The 
independent organization described the IETF as a sibling.  It does 
not look good when siblings cannot talk to each other.

>Why not?

There is a draft written by the IAB in which it is mentioned that 
"The deployment of ECN across the Interent had failed."  It is nearly 
impossible to innovate at that layer and get deployment across the 
Internet.  Most of the services in wide use on the Internet are built 
above what the IETF calls the "application layer".  It could be said 
that the web is the transport layer.

On a tangent, if services in wide use were permissionless, the 
following should not be an issue: 
https://www.ft.com/content/75796bce-d9dd-11e6-944b-e7eb37a6aa8e

>Which ones are you referring to?

I was referring to regulatory barriers.  I have asked my regulator 
about that; I don't consider the regulation(s) as related to the IETF 
in any way.

>If you provide examples we could discuss them or integrate them in the
>draft.

If I am not mistaken, the draft is not about regulatory barriers.  As 
such, the examples which I might provide won't fit in it.

S. Moonesamy

I have two problems with this claim, and since this discussion about
consulting everyone appears to be continuing I think I want to object
to the apparent line of reasoning.

The first problem I have is that it simply isn't true that it is
always better to ask someone from Country X about the situation in
Country X than it is to ask some expert about the relevant situation.
People are often extraordinarily confused about how their own country
works.  Many Canadians, for instance, persist in believing that they
vote for the Prime Minister, but I could ask anyone properly familiar
with Westminster systems and each would answer the question correctly.

The second problem I have is that the second  contains two questions,
one of which appears to be a question about how people feel and the
other of which is one of simple entailment given the definitions of
"human rights" and "infringed".  Neither of them, anyway, is relevant
to what is in the previous , except of course that _ex hypothesi_ we
have to ask the person in the Netherlands about the effect on him or
her.  

I think there is a legitimate question about the population of
reviewers for this document (given that it's in the IRTF, that's
hardly surprising).  I think the representativity of nationals of the
countries of the world is not that legitimate question.

Best regards,

A

Three things an interdisciplinary approach would bring in would be:

1. People adept at their discipline tend to develop one skill and
that's an eye towards unintended consequences.

Accounting may seem like just a lot of arithmetic and some pages of
rules until your accountant sees you've created a risk of an expensive
govt audit. Computer and networking systems people obsess, and rightly
so, on looking for unintended consequences. And so with govt policy
veterans, lawyers, etc. As is often said in business the primary
purpose of professionals you hire is to keep you out of trouble, not
get you out of trouble.

2. People from other disciplines can help improve language
particularly where that language is to be understood by people in
their discipline as the authors intended. But also just general
accuracy and precision. Mere dictionaries are often not sufficient,
terms of art abound, even intellectual fashions abound and may push
the wrong buttons. How many here might be comfortable using the word
"populism" in a sentence to be read by a wide policy audience?

3. Professionals in their discipline tend to have a lot of experience
in the cost of actually implementing what might seem on the surface
good ideas. Not only in money but in terms of controversy,
distraction, and benefit. A software professional can make a good
guess at what the cost of implementing a protocol change might be. A
policy professional might do the same in the effort it would take to
gain broad acceptance of its intentions, and from whom.

Which is to say I agree with what Eliot Lear actually said.

I interpreted threaded as what is specified in RFC 5322 while you 
probably mean something different.  I'll try a different style of 
reply as it may be what you mean by "discussion inline".

I would not say that protocols have no impact on society.  I'll use a 
case from the draft:  "[RFC7540] does not mandate Transport Layer 
Security or any other form of encryption, is also does not support 
opportunistic encryption, so the vulnerabilities listed above for 
HTTP/1 are also valid for HTTP/2 as defined in [RFC7540]".  Are the 
considerations in Section 10 of RFC 7450 inadequate?

Would I advise a customer deploying that protocol to support 
encryption?  Yes.  What about the human rights aspect?  Are there 
cases which I can use as evidence to show that the vulnerability 
harmed a person(s)?  That's what the customer is going to ask.  The 
customer will not be convinced by the examples in the draft as it is 
unfortunately stuff which the customer cannot relate to.  It is 
similar to the "impact on real life events" which you mentioned.

I'll comment in my reply to Andrew.

Although I may provide some support, I do not usually do outreach or 
diversity at the regional level.  I would be happy to work with you 
as long as it is not related to a political matter.  My preference up 
to now is to remain neutral.

Ok.

In my opinion, permissionless innovation is economic and/or 
political, e.g. business models.  At a national level, it may be a 
matter of public policy.  It does not have much to do with 
"end-to-end".  What I am saying is that the barriers are of a 
regulatory nature.  Permissionless innovation may be workable in, for 
example, the U.S.  I doubt that it would work well in markets whether 
the Internet regulations are different.

S. Moonesamy

Hi Andrew,

Quoting from the message at=20

I'll refrain from commenting about Canada as it=20
is a matter for the citizens of that country to discuss about.

My comment was about how a person is affected by=20
the decision, and not, how a person feels about=20
the decision.  If the decision is about the=20
(local) laws it would be better to ask a person=20
with relevant expertise or experience about that.

>The second problem I have is that the second =B6 contains two questions,

The point was about whether the person would be=20
able to challenge that decision.  One of the=20
arguments being made for blocking HTTP [1] is to=20
restrict foreign influence on issues which may be=20
considered as a matter of national security.

I used "nationals" as an example.  There is=20
another way to look at this.  For example, are=20
you (used in general terms) trying to get a=20
breath of reviews or would you settle=20
for  reviews from one part of the world?  If it=20
is the latter, it will be used as an example by=20
countries which are concerned about unbalanced representativity.

I'm not sure whether there is a misunderstanding, but
I also supported Eliot's suggestion (I said
"This indeed needs more discussion between the disciplines").
My point was that interdisciplinary work requires even more
than just several reviews by a community from other disciplines.
Especially, a common understanding of terms, thinking and
viewpoints usually requires lots of (close) interactions. More reviews
from other disciplines is inevitable and a good start, but
probably not sufficient.

Regards,
 Roland

I find it hard to argue about whether a fictional customer might or
might not be convinced. On the other hand, a lot of companies do care
about their human rights impact and even implement the UN Guiding
Principles on Business and Human Rights:

https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/find-companies

So I some companies are convinced, and they might think their customers
care about this too.

I think we're actually already doing quite a good job of (starting to)
attracting people from other disciplines here. I'd hope this is only the
beginning, and pushing out a draft would probably get us more exposure
and thus a higher ability to get people in and work on follow-up drafts.

With the film we've made, and a lot of talks Corinne and I held about
this topic to ISOC fellows, at universities, at NGO's in the global
south (Argentina, Brazil (Rio and Sao Paulo), Kenya) and the global
north (Amsterdam, Brussels, Washington DC, Wellington), we see that
there is interest, but there are still barriers. Both Avri and I
publicized the draft in a lot of non-IETF/IRTF mailinglists for
reviewed, but unfortunately some response I got was that quite some
people did not feel confident enough to post here, which is a pity imho.

Therefore I hope the perfect will not be the enemy of the good here. As
someone who is quite invested into cross-disciplinary research, I could
not support this quest more, but as a lot of things, I think this is
iterative.

All the best,

Niels

I like this proposal a lot and would indeed add more clarity, a
justification as well as a genealogy. I have added it to the text:

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Human Rights Protocol Considerations of the IETF.

        Title           : Research into Human Rights Protocol Considerations
        Authors         : Niels ten Oever
                          Corinne Cath
	Filename        : draft-irtf-hrpc-research-08.txt
	Pages           : 72
	Date            : 2017-01-20

Abstract:
   This document aims to propose guidelines for human rights
   considerations, similar to the work done on the guidelines for
   privacy considerations [RFC6973].  This is achieved by providing a
   proposal for a vocabulary to discuss the relation between human
   rights and Internet protocols, an overview of the discussion in
   technical and academic literature and communities, a proposal for the
   mapping of the relation between human rights and technical concepts,
   as well as guidelines.

   If you want to see how to apply this work to your own, you can
   directly go to Section 6.  The rest of the document explains the
   background of the guidelines and how they were developed.

   This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is
   published for informational purposes.

   This document is a product of the Internet Research Task Force
   (IRTF).  The IRTF publishes the results of Internet-related research
   and development activities.  This documents aims to be a consensus
   document of the Human Rights Protocol Consideration Research Group of
   the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF).

OK, I'll wait.

In the mean time, an interesting read on this subject:

The Dictator's Digital Toolkit: Explaining Variation in Internet Filtering in Authoritarian Regimes

I'll leave it to anyone who has experience in the field to determine 
whether what I wrote reflects reality or not.  The draft mentions a 
few cases where companies sold surveillance  products to monitor 
internet users.  I will be convinced about those guiding principles 
when I see people doing what they say.

I suggest researching about countries with historic monopolies [1].

Hi,

Thanks for getting a revision out so quickly.  Am having trouble keeping
up with you and am still reading. I figure I need to reread it all as a
coherent piece of work.

It would be helpful if those who had issues with the reviewed version
could check the diff, at minimum, to see if they are now ok with what
the doc says. And then let the list know.


Also want to throw out another question that has been rumbling about in
the back of my thoughts: is this informational or experimental RFC track?

I think it is recommending something that can be tried experimentally
and is part of a research effort. On an informational, I would think it
was suggesting something that was no longer so speculative but was
information that could be used reliably without confusion, and I am not
sure the group thinks we are there yet.

It may just be a quibble, but would like opinions.

Continuing thanks to the authors and reviewers.

from https://www.ietf.org/iesg/informational-vs-experimental.html

4.2.1 Experimental

The "Experimental" designation typically denotes a specification that is
part of some research or development effort. Such a specification is
published for the general information of the Internet technical
community and as an archival record of the work, subject only to
editorial considerations and to verification that there has been
adequate coordination with the standards process (see below). An
Experimental specification may be the output of an organized Internet
research effort (e.g., a Research Group of the IRTF), an IETF Working
Group, or it may be an individual contribution.

4.2.2 Informational

An "Informational" specification is published for the general
information of the Internet community, and does not represent an
Internet community consensus or recommendation. The Informational
designation is intended to provide for the timely publication of a very
broad range of responsible informational documents from many sources,
subject only to editorial considerations and to verification that there
has been adequate coordination with the standards process (see section

Thanks for this Avri,

This might also help with people making up their mind about your questions =
vis a vis informational vs experimental:

https://www.ietf.org/iesg/informational-vs-experimental.html

In my opinion this would work best as informational.

Best,

Niels

Avri,

I myself seek no more changes to the document.  I would, however, just
ask that you take on board seeking more reviewers prior to advancing
this work, specifically to check that references to work in fields
outside the classic expertise of the IRTF/IETF are being appropriately
applied.  I view this as a bare minimum test.

Eliot

Hi,

Thanks Eliot.  I would note that we have had at least on full fledged
academic who is not one of the normal IETF/IRTF crowd review it, and she
did make some remarks about the references and how they are being used. 
I have been looking for academics and other advocacy people to review
and will continue to do so.

Thanks

avri

Hi Avri,

I would look at "Experimental" v/s "Informational" in terms of future 
standardization of a protocol.  The document is not about a 
protocol.  As such, "Informational" is a better fit.  There isn't a 
RFC track; the document is intended for publication in the IRTF Stream.
