        Title:      An IETF with Much Diversity

The process of producing today's Internet technologies through a
culture of open participation and diverse collaboration has proved
strikingly efficient and effective, and it is distinctive among
standards organizations.  During the early years of the IETF and its
antecedent, participation was almost entirely composed of a small
group of well-funded, American, white, male technicians,
demonstrating a distinctive and challenging group dynamic, both in
management and in personal interactions.  In the case of the IETF,
interaction style can often contain singularly aggressive behavior,
often including singularly hostile tone and content.  Groups with
greater diversity make better decisions.  Obtaining meaningful
diversity requires more than generic good will and statements of
principle.  Many different behaviors can serve to reduce participant
diversity or participation diversity.  This document discusses IETF
participation in terms of the nature of diversity and practical
issues that can increase or decrease it.  The document represents the
authors' assessments and recommendations, following general
discussions of the issues in the IETF.

Dear all,

I hope this email finds you all well. Please find here the next
version of the methodology ID, most changes were suggested directly
before the Yokohama meeting and at the Yokohama meeting:

https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-varon-hrpc-methodology-02

Furthermore I would like to ask the group whether you would all think
it's OK if we move the current active documents [0] [1] [2] over to
the IRTF track [3] and make them hrpc group documents, since we're
chartered now.

Furthermore I would like to gather input from you all whether people
would like to volunteer to continue the work in either the
methodology, glossary or report document.

During the Yokohama meeting several suggestions have come up to
include more technical analysis (such as DDoS), and we decided we
would try to deduce protocol transcending  considerations. Would
people like to volunteer for any of these tasks or have other tasks /
research they think would be appropriate?

Looking forward to hear what you think.

Best,

Niels

Hi all,

We had to cut off the questions and discussion on Corinne's thesis - A
Case Study of Coding Rights [0] in Yokohama. I wanted to create one
more opportunity to discuss the thesis. Mostly because I think the
thesis is a great piece of work and very constructive overview of
different issues we're working on and because it could also lead us
forward. Also because I still have a few questions left. Of course
other peoples questions and comments are also very much encouraged.

1.
You define 'openness' as 'the absence of centralised points of
control' (p17). Do you think this is the mainly used definition of
openness? Or are there others? If this is the main one, should we
perhaps add it to the glossary? Openess is currently defined in the
glossary as:
 The quality of the unfiltered Internet that allows for free
      access to other hosts
Which is quite a different definition. Could you please elaborate on
your rationale / choice for this definitions

2.
You connect 'content agnosticism' with 'all packets are equal'. I am
not sure if that is correct. I think content agnosticism means:
packets are not treated differently based on their content. Would you
agree?
Glossary definition:
	Treating network traffic identically regardless of content.

3. On p.20 you seem to use distributed and decentralized
interchangeably, is this intentional?

4. I like the conclusion on page 23, this quote from RFC3935 could
make it even stronger:
   The Internet isn't value-neutral, and neither is the IETF.  We want
   the Internet to be useful for communities that share our commitment
   to openness and fairness.  We embrace technical concepts such as
   decentralized control, edge-user empowerment and sharing of
   resources, because those concepts resonate with the core values of
   the IETF community.  These concepts have little to do with the
   technology that's possible, and much to do with the technology that
   we choose to create.

5. You use different ways of describing the relationship between
protocol developers and human rights. Sometimes you talk about
encoding human rights (which you put on the same level with
'protecting human rights') p.42, sometimes you also talk about
'instantiating human rights in protocols p.47, sometimes also
'directly instantiating the right ....' p.53
Later on you make the clear difference between 'protocol development
[that is] guided by human rights principles' and 'instantiating [human
rights] in protocols' p. 53. Could you give definitions of the
different processes or explain the differences among them?


6. Sometimes you seem to argue there is a relative homogeneous
normative conceptualization of the Internet among engineers at the
IETF and sometimes you seem to argue that there is much diversity
(which stimulates a tussle). Could you elaborate on this?

7. Which parts of your paper do you think could / would fit well in
the methodology draft [1], glossary draft [2] and/or report draft [3]?

Greatly looking forward to your response.

Best,


Niels

Dear all,

Looks great! I think its a good thing to move the active documents to the
IETF track.

Also happy to help with the methodology and report document, or other
issues as they come up!

Best,

Corinne

I think this is a "call for adoption by the research group" of the three
outstanding drafts.  I support research group adoption of all three
drafts.

 Internet Standards as an Arena for Conflict
 : Pursuant to the principle of constant change, since the function and scope of the Internet evolves, so does the role of the IETF in developing standards. Internet standards are adopted on the basis of a series of criteria, including high technical quality, support by community consensus, and their overall benefit to the Internet. The latter calls for an assessment of the interests of all affected parties and the specifications’ impact on the Internet’s users. In this respect, the effective exercise of the human rights of the Internet users is a relevant consideration that needs to be  appreciated in the standardization process insofar as it is directly linked to the reliability and core values of the Internet. {{RFC1958}} {{RFC0226}} {{RFC3724}}

 #### Surveillance of Communication
 
-The XMPP protocol specifies the standard by which communication of channels may be encrypted, but it does not provide visibility to clients of whether their communications are encrypted on each link. In particular, even when both clients ensure that they have an encrypted connection to their XMPP server to ensure that their local network is unable to read or disrupt the messages they send, the protocol does not provide visibility into the encryption status between the two servers. As such, clients may be subject to selective disruption of communications by an intermediate network which disrupts communications based on keywords found through Deep Packet Inspection. While many operators have commited to only establishing encrypted links from their servers in recognition of this vulnerability, it remains impossible for users to audit this behavior and is not required by the protocol {{xmppmanifesto}}.

 In particular, section 13.14 of the protocol specification {{RFC6120}} explicitly acknowledges the existence of a downgrade attack where an adversary controlling an intermediate network can force the inter domain federation between servers to revert to a non-encrypted protocol were selective messages can then be disrupted.

The Strengthening the Internet (STRINT) workshop assembled one
hundred participants in London for two days in early 2014 to discuss
how the technical community, and in particular the IETF and the W3C,
should react to Pervasive Monitoring and more generally how to
strengthen the Internet in the face of such attacks.  The discussions
covered issues of terminology, the role of user interfaces, classes
of mitigation, some specific use cases, transition strategies
(including opportunistic encryption), and more.  The workshop ended
with a few high-level recommendations, that it is believed could be
implemented and could help strengthen the Internet.  This is the
report of that workshop.

Note that this document is a report on the proceedings of the
workshop.  The views and positions documented in this report are
those of the workshop participants and do not necessarily reflect IAB
views and positions.
