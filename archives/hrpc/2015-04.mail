Hi everyone

Maybe some of you remember and have read the APC publication "Human
rights and Internet protocols"[0]. APC was considering refreshing this
at some point, but perhaps in the form of a visualisation of the concepts=
=2E

That leads me to imagine that there are other ideas for visualisation or
infographics related to this work. Could folks share their thoughts? We
should explore opportunities together, I think, for explaining different
concepts to different audiences.

Thanks for this, in this light, how do you see the proposal made by
Mark Nottingham to make end-users rights the highest priorities?
Perhaps that would provide an extra tool/axis to balance rights?

Thanks! Adding these concepts to the working draft of the ID.

Connectivity is already there under freedom of expression, do you
think that would suffice?

Why would one need the concept of intent when it can already been
shown that a protocol is causing human rights violations?

Intent is very hard to show, and only having a protocol be used the
way it was intended would probably have negative consequences for
permission-less innovation.

Looking forward to discuss.

Best,

Niels

You seem to start from the assumption that a protocol *causes* human =
rights violations. It would help me if you could cite a case.

Cause: http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cause

As we discussed at the IETF, the only one that comes close (that I can =
quickly think of) is an IP address. It identifies a locality in the =
routing system and can, under some circumstances, be correlated with a =
geographic location and/or a subscriber.

I would argue doesn=E2=80=99t *cause* human rights violations, any more =
than the fact that my geographic address is on my business card. But it =
might give someone intent on violating someone else=E2=80=99s rights the =
information they need to do so.

In my mind, the concept that a protocol element or design, or the misuse =
of a protocol element or design, is *causal* in a human rights violation =
remains to be shown.

I was reacting to Aaron who said that if a protocol caused human
rights issues, one can speak of malicious intent, but if a protocol is
causing human rights issues, one doesn't need to show intent.

But your question remains valid.

I would say that a protocol infringes on a users right to freedom of
expression if it in-transparently negatively impacts the connectivity
of the user.

This could be done either intentionally or unintentionally.

Am working on examples, but one (contentious) example that comes to
mind is DRM which is often meant as a 'speed bump' that merely 'keeps
honest people honest', but it is also limiting the non-commercial and
personal use of content and also limiting the access to knowledge and
the access to culture.

EFF argues that EME (standardization of DRM in HTML by W3C) runs
counter to the philosophy that "the Web needs to be a universal
ecosystem that is based on open standards and fully implementable on
equal terms by anyone, anywhere, without permission or negotiation."
EME undermines the Web's compatibility by allowing sites to demand
"specific proprietary third-party software or even special hardware
and particular operating systems." [0]

Best,

Niels

This paper was important for us in envisioning this research, great
you're thinking of putting it back under attention!

I think a lot of people would benefit from a good visualization of the
hourglass (which is now actually, as someone pointed out at IETF92, a
double stemmed martini glass (IPv4 & IPv6)), and what it actually means.

A good, meaningful and easy visualization of the OSI model would also
be golden, even-though there are other layer models around as well.
This doesn't mean simply showing the model, but also explaining it of
course.

Personally I think packet-switching and IP are most fun to explain and
is really beneficial for people to understand, and could be done in a
nice visual way. By showing a stream of data and/or file being chopped
up into packets/datagrams, send over the network and routed via
different paths, and being put back together on the other side. This
might be too complex though.

If this would be a multi-layered visualization you could also perhaps
click on the packet and see what it looks like, such as the ones made
by Ange Albertini [0]

Hope this helps.

Best,

Niels

Well, I think EFF is a little over the top. I would expect that someone =
offering a service or content has the right to say under what =
circumstances they are willing to do so. A grocery store sells food to =
anyone that can enter the store and pay for the goods they choose. I =
have, I think, a right to enter the store, choose food, pay for it, and =
leave the store; I don=E2=80=99t have the right to leave without paying. =
If Netflix is the =E2=80=9Cstore=E2=80=9D and video service is the =
=E2=80=9Cfood=E2=80=9D, we have an analogous situation. I have the right =
to purchase content services from Netflix, at a a mutually agreed price. =
Youtube is also analogous, but with a price point of $0, and as a result =
no requirement for much of the machinery for exchanging money.

What I would require of an online retailer is that what they require, =
and the means by which they ensure that requirements are met, be =
transparent, and that the retailer be the person responsible for =
enforcement of whatever provisions s/he requires.

Digital products differ from food (in this context) primarily in that =
food, once consumed, is unavailable, while digital content remains =
available and usable. If a company spends half a billion dollars =
creating a bit of content, I think it has a reasonable expectation of =
recovering the cost of doing so plus profit. If once it releases the =
first copy that gets distributed for free (=E2=80=9Cinformation wants to =
be free=E2=80=9D), that expectation is no longer reasonable - people =
will choose the unencumbered and free copy to the encumbered copy. If it =
does not recover its costs and make something extra, it has neither the =
capital nor the motivation to make the next bit of content. So hammering =
on the point that =E2=80=9Cinformation wants to be free=E2=80=9D is a =
good way to make such information no longer exist. There needs to be a =
compromise unless the objective is to put the industry out of business.

Where I do get a little antsy is with pricing. If I make a bit of =
content that can be delivered as a hard copy book or a set of bits =
delivered to my kindle-or-whatever t a nominal cost, when I purchase the =
kindle version, I don=E2=80=99t think I should pay the price of a =
physical copy. The value is comparable. If the cost is comparable, that =
might justify the price being comparable. But I suspect that the cost =
(while non-zero - someone bought the bandwidth to deliver it) is =
significantly less than the creation and distribution of a physical =
object. Hence, for me, if the price is comparable or higher than the =
cost of the physical object, I vote with my feet and don=E2=80=99t buy =
it.

So I actually don=E2=80=99t have a problem with digital watermarking and =
other methods of proving that someone created the content, and =
expressing as a condition of the purchase that it is for the use of the =
person to whom it was sold.

What I do have a problem with is legal remedies like SOPA etc that make =
the conduit (the ISP) responsible to enforce such things or collect =
revenue. Your water pipes aren=E2=80=99t responsible for the water that =
flows through them apart from contamination of the water. Why would your =
ISP be responsible for what flows through the Intertubes?

Dear all,

I hope this email finds you well. Behind the scenes were working hard
on the editing of the film of the recorded interviews we've done at
IETF92 in Dallas, and there is more interesting work coming up, about
which you'll hear more soon.

We've also requested a 90 minutes timeslot for the IETF meeting in
Prague.

In the mean time Lars has asked us to come up with a draft charter,
which would still change if/when the research group would be formally
chartered. This text would be a placeholder and inform people (in the
datatracker) about what this group is proposing to do.

We came up with the following, I  would like to send a finalized
version of this to Lars in a week, I am very much looking forward to
your comments.

Best,

The Human Rights Protocol Consideration Proposed Research Group is
chartered to research whether standards and protocols can solidify,
enable or threaten user rights. The research departs for the problem
statement that decisive and human rights enabling characteristics of
the Internet might be degraded if they're not properly defined,
described and protected. Not defining these characteristics could
result in (partial) loss of functionality and connectivity.

As stated in RFC 1958, the Internet aims to be the global network of
networks that provides unfettered connectivity to all users at all
times and for any content.  Open, secure and reliable
connectivity is essential for rights such as freedom of expression and
freedom of association, as defined in the Universal Declaration   of
Human Rights.  Therefore, considering connectivity as the ultimate
objective of the Internet, this makes a clear case that the Internet
is not only an enabler of human rights, but that human rights lie at
the basis of, and are ingrained in, the architecture of the network.

Objective
This research aims to expose the relations between protocols and human
rights, and propose guidelines to protect the rights enabling
environment in future protocol development in a manner similar to the
work done for RFC 6973 on Privacy Consideration Guidelines,

Outputs
The research group plans on using  a variety of research methods to
create different outputs including (but not limited to):

- - Internet drafts - (some of which may be put on IRSG RFC track)
These would concern tracking of the project, methodology, and would
define any possible protocol considerations.

- - Policy and academic papers
For in depth analysis and discussion on the relationship between human
rights and the Internet architecture and protocols.

- - Film based on interview with members of the community
To give an accessible insight into the variety of opinions on this
topic represented in the community by .

- - Data analysis and visualization
To research and visualize the language used in current and historic
RFCs and mailinglist discussions to expose core architectural
principles and language and deliberations on end-user rights.

Membership
Membership is open to any interested parties who intend to remain
current with the published documents and mailing list issues.

Thanks for your suggestions Kathleen, integrated your suggestions and
made some further changes.

Since the Research Group is still a Proposed Research Group that is
not officially chartered yet (this is a decision made by the IRTF
chair), I think that should remain in the title, but please correct me
if I am wrong.

Now it reads:

Background
The Human Rights Protocol Consideration Proposed Research Group is
chartered to research whether standards and protocols can solidify,
enable or threaten user rights. The research group takes as its
starting point the problem statement that decisive and human rights
enabling characteristics of the Internet might be degraded if they're
not properly defined, described and protected. Not defining these
characteristics could result in (partial) loss of functionality and
connectivity.

As stated in RFC 1958, the Internet aims to be the global network of
networks that provides unfettered connectivity to all users at all
times and for any content.  Open, secure and reliable
connectivity is essential for rights such as freedom of expression and
freedom of association, as defined in the Universal Declaration   of
Human Rights.  Therefore, considering connectivity as the ultimate
objective of the Internet, this makes a clear case that the Internet
is not only an enabler of human rights, but that human rights lie at
the basis of, and are ingrained in, the architecture of the network.

Objective
This research aims to expose the relations between protocols and human
rights, and propose guidelines to protect the rights enabling
environment in future protocol development in a manner similar to the
work done for RFC 6973 on Privacy Consideration Guidelines,

Outputs
The research group plans on using  a variety of research methods to
create different outputs including (but not limited to):

- - Internet drafts - (some of which may be put on IRSG RFC track)
These would concern tracking of the project, methodology, and would
define any possible protocol considerations.

- - Policy and academic papers
For in depth analysis and discussion on the relationship between human
rights and the Internet architecture and protocols.

- - Film based on interviews with members of the community
To give an accessible insight into the variety of opinions on this
topic represented in the community.

- - Data analysis and visualization
To research and visualize the language used in current and historic
RFCs and mailinglist discussions to expose core architectural
principles and language and deliberations on end-user rights.

Membership
Membership is open to any interested parties who intend to remain
current with the published documents and mailing list issues.

Hiya,

For context, I still have no clue what if any outcomes we might see
here, but I very much support the idea of trying to find that out:-)
(Assuming we have enough folks active etc.)

Some comments/questions below:

What is a "user right" is it the same as a "human right"? I'd say
lose the former term would be better.

And I think you could start with a pointer to what you think defines
human rights? (The UDHR? [1]) Many IETF type folks won't be familiar
with that so it's worth an explicit reference maybe.

  [1] http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/

Hmm. I'm not sure I agree 100% with the thesis there. But it's
defensible I agree. My issue with it is that I have seen cases
where the act of asking if X is allowed results in X, that used
to be not-disallowed, no longer being allowed;-)

I think you could make a better argument to the effect that we
don't know much about how Internet protocols and human rights
intersect and since the Internet is now quite important, it's
a good idea to study that.

"basis of, and are ingrained in," may be overstatement. I think it
would be fair to say that the architecture makes assumptions that
clearly overlap with the UDHR though, even if we don't fully
understand the overlaps.

Maybe education is an objective? Both so HR folks learn more
about real protocol stuff but also vice versa, so pointy headed
protocol developers learn some more about how their work might
influence HR.

Hi!

This looks like very interesting work.

. . .
>>The Human Rights Protocol Consideration Proposed Research Group is
>> chartered to research whether standards and protocols can solidify,
>> enable or threaten user rights.

The charter should be to be very clear about what Human Rights are.  For
example, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was mentioned (below),
but just as a reference, and not as the authoritative source.  It may be
obvious to many that it would be the source, but there may be other
interpretations.

Along the same vein of being clear and explicit, the paragraph above
starts talking about human rights, but it ends with =B3user rights=B2.  Are
these the same?  Will =B3user rights=B2, as in (I assume) users of the
Internet be defined as part of the RG?  Maybe that is what this next part
means:

Does this last piece of text mean that Internet connectivity (which means
exactly what?) is (or should be declared) a human right?  I haven=B9t read
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in a while, but I don=B9t remembe=
r
it talking about the Internet.  Maybe, as you say above, the case is clear
in the relationship between the Internet objectives and Human Rights =8B
but, does it mean that the Internet is just an enabler or should it a
human right in itself?  I know that several countries have put forth
legislation to that effect. I might be getting more into politics at this
point =8B it seems hard not to..

The point of my comments is:  please be clear on the starting point.

Thanks!

Alvaro.

Maybe, protect is a strong word and will be taken completely literally.
I don't know if what we are doing is creating "guidelines to protect". I

efficiency, interoperability, scalability, integrity, etc. etc.
