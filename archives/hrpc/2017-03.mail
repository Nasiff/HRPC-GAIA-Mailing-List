RPZ has been adopted by the IETF DNSOP working group (and the new
draft published). This is interesting for us because most of the
discussions pre-adoption were about human rights (RPZ can facilitate
censorship), is technology neutral, etc.

All

The Call for Adoption on draft-vixie-dns-rpz ended some time ago, and the
results were a solid in favor of adoption.  However, the legitmacy of the
argument in opposition to adopting seems fairly significant about certain
parts of the draft.

In discussing this with our AD, the opinion is that if this same
opposition  manifests in the IETF last call there would have
reservations about advancing it.

So if we consider this rough consensus for  the purposes of adoption
it means we believe we will be better off with an improved, working-
group-owned document then this one.

We=E2=80=99re going to go ahead and adopt it for DNSOP, with the intention =
of
resolving the concerns people expressed by keeping the status as
informational (not standards track) and making sure the cautions and
limitations the WG discussed on the use of RPZ are clear in the document.

Following up on the ISOC Policy Fellows discussion yesterday and a =
conversation I had with Corrine later.=20

I found myself disconcerted, as I usually do (I have made this comment =
before, but this time I have a little more noodling behind it), when =
Niels showed the slide that referred to RFC 1958's comment on the =
end-to-end principle and human rights. Here's my discomfort point.

I'm glad to see that the principles that underly the Internet lend =
themselves to a Human Rights discussion; that's a good thing, and I =
might be bothered if they didn't. However, the assertion that the =
designers of the Internet were thinking about Human Rights doesn't hold. =
The End-to-End Principle is stated twice in Saltzer's paper; the =
statement in the abstract is the one I concern myself with (a lower =
layer should perform the intent of a higher layer, so that a message =
sent by one system to another arrives at the intended system, and the =
message delivered is the one that was sent), as the one made in the body =
of the text doesn't hold in the Internet (routing is done by the network =
without help from or reference to the opinions of an application; the =
application identifies its intended correspondent by name or address, =
and the network gets the packet there).=20

The reason we assert that a lower layer should perform the intent of a =
higher layer has nothing to do with rights, human or otherwise. It has =
everything to do with the operation of a reliable and predictable =
service. When I communicate with a peer, if I find myself communicating =
with someone else or the message delivered is changed, I have a security =
issue and a privacy issue. In time, people will learn that this happens, =
and cease using the service - as their intentions are thwarted. The =
objectives of the principles by which the Internet is designed are about =
the usefulness of a service for the purpose of communication, nothing =
more and nothing less.

This distinction becomes very important in the Internet of Things. In =
IoT, there is no human in the loop. If our intentions are about human =
rights, the rules could be completely different when there is no human =
to have a right. But if the principle is about providing a reliable and =
predictable service, the principle always applies.

I also commented to Corrine that I'm far less concerned about "rights" =
than I am about "responsibilities", and would prefer that the discussion =
were framed in those terms. A "right", to me, is a license to get upset =
and perhaps to sue. If I ask what "rights" might apply to TCP, I guess =
the TCP user would have the "right" to send a SYN, to attempt to open a =
session. That's not much of a right. But the responsibilities of a TCP =
would include management of the window to maximize good put without =
undue interaction or stress on the network or other TCP sessions, the =
responsibility to respond to an incoming SYN, and so on. As someone who =
writes RFCs, if I'm asked to enumerate the "rights" impacts of a =
protocol, procedure, or white paper, I'm likely to be a little lost - =
beyond dealing with personally identifiable information, which doesn't =
occur below the application layer except by inference in the presence of =
other data, I'm not sure I have anything to say. Responsibilities, =
however, can be pretty apparent.

I personally would wish that the discussion were framed as being about =
the responsibilities of a person or system that communicates, not the =
rights of a human being that may or may not even exist in the context.=

Dear Fred,

curiously enough your last point makes lots of sense from a human rights
law point of view too.
A right has always a corresponding duty. As a matter of fact a right can
have a corresponding set of duties of either a specific or general nature.
For example, the duty of of the State to take (or refrain from) a specific
action or the duty of a State to set up a general framework which will
enable the effective exercise of rights (the latter category we call them
positive obligations).
>From your point of view it is very reasonable that you are thinking in
terms of what your duties would be when you design something. At the same
time, however, having a rights-based approach (assessing the impact of a
protocol) could also help identifying some (not necessarily all) of one's
duties.

Hope this makes sense to you too.
Mando

Possibly this is a problem statement, rather than a statement of =

Hi Fred,

I think you made a very good point about rights, responsibilities,
and an Internet of Things without humans in the loop. I'd like to
expand a bit on the potential role of the end-to-end argument in this
context.

If I understood you correctly, you are interpreting the "end-to-end
principle" more in the direction of transport "Transparency" (see also
https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2775.txt) and I'm not sure that I can
derive it from the actual paper here:
http://web.mit.edu/Saltzer/www/publications/endtoend/endtoend.pdf

To me it's a minimality principle that suggests to avoid putting
application-dependent functions into the network (the paper also
speaks of a "kind of Occam's Razor" in the conclusion). Otherwise
the network would become unnecessarily complex and in the end, the
network may not have enough knowledge to make the correct decision
anyway. Consequences are higher robustness, broader application support
and easier innovation, because you don't need to change the network in
case of new applications.

So especially in case of error or failure handling, application-specific
knowledge is often required (as made clearer by the examples in the
paper). This knowledge may stem from the programmer or even
from the user, e.g., the application can be configured with user
preferences and try to act accordingly. So it is quite likely that
in an Internet of Things, you may possess devices that act on your
behalf and according to your policies. These devices may also
interact with devices of other users according to their policies.

Applying the end-to-end argument in systems design would now suggest
to leave the decision in case of conflicts(*) to the endpoints, since
they have (probably user-specified) knowledge how to react accordingly
(I think the "Tussle in Cyberspace" paper also fits here).
In the end, you are responsible for the devices that you own
and attach to the Internet - thus there is probably still a human
involved, although not in the direct communication loop.

I think that the draft - among others - tries to point out that some
human rights may be affected adversely depending on how protocols are
designed and networks are operated. One suggestion is to use a
(protocol) design that minimizes such potential interference. IMHO
finding potential impacts is difficult and the draft wants to provide
some guidance.

Regards,
 Roland

(*) Technically, we may frequently see (often resource) conflicts that
originally stem from different user preferences, e.g., a router needs
to decide which packet is the next to serve, normally without knowing
the importance of the packet to the user. How much intelligence
should/must be built into the network for conflict resolution and how
much can we leave to the application/user?

I'm keying off the abstract ("The principle, called the end-to-end =
argument, suggests that functions placed at low levels of a system may =
be redundant or of little value when compared with the cost of providing =
them at that low level."). The other statement in the document is in the =
introductory text, and is quoted in RFC 1958: "The function in question =
can completely and correctly be implemented only with the knowledge and =
help of the application standing at the end points of the communication =
system. Therefore, providing that questioned function as a feature of =
the communication system itself is not possible. (Sometimes an =
incomplete version of the function provided by the communication system =
may be useful as a performance enhancement.)" I observe that Internet =
Routing, both IGP and BGP, operate within the network at the network =
layer rather than finding help from the application, which it calls the =
"host", and therefore is not consistent with that version of the =
argument.

If one agrees with the common statement that network address translation =
or filtering of routes and traffic violate the end-to-end principle, =
then transparency is critical to the end-to-end principle.

I would suggest that you read a couple of books like Russ White's "The =
Art of Network Architecture: Business-Driven Design (Networking =
Technology)" or Bill Norton's "The Internet Peering Playbook: Connecting =
to the Core of the Internet", and then comment on how simple the =
Internet is...

I'm not sure that I disagree with that. However, it's fairly easy to say =
"Firewall X prevents free speech" or "Route filtering in BGP Routing can =
be used to prevent connectivity, and is commonly used for that purpose =
with low reputation networks". It is also largely vacuous from the =
perspective of someone writing a protocol. Yes, things can be abused - =
anything can be abused. One RFC that I co-authored, =
https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3924.txt, was explicitly written =
because of that - it required an audit trail when lawful intercept =
technology is in use, because once it exists (and governments worldwide =
mandate its existence) the tool can be used by anyone - and there are =
known cases in which it has been used by organized crime and state =
actors (RFC 7528). That said, how might that consideration apply to RFC =
3315 (MIB for Frame Relay) or the interconnect architecture (RFC 2427)? =
RFC 6018 (Greynets)? When I talk about "60 RFCs", one of those is RFC =
3924; the rest are pretty deeply technical, along the lines of RFCs 2427 =
or 6018.

As I said, I am pretty comfortable talking about responsibilities. In =
the RFC 6018 context, if I have traffic in my network that acts like =
attack traffic, I could argue that the network (its technology and its =
administration) have a responsibility to protect users and equipment, =
and the network element implementing the Greynet technology has the =
responsibility to *only* interdict that traffic. I might go so far as to =
say that a low reputation link or route usually has a low reputation =
because that responsibility has been abrogated, and the argument for =
restoring its reputation has to do with an inaccurate verdict or a =
change in behavior. Stating that in terms of the UNDP - I could probably =
twist something until it resembled a relevant statement, but it would =
not be a straightforward application of those concepts.=20

Responding to a previous comment, yes, rights probably imply duties, but =
I'm not at all sure that duties imply rights. The argument that has to =
be made is that responsibilities imply rights worded in ways found in =
the UNDP. Contracts, in this case, imply duties, and business =
imperatives imply duties. But I'm not convinced that they imply rights, =
or are driven by rights.=

I have reservations about the format of yesterday's meeting in
Chicago. IMHO, there were too many formal presentations and not enough
discussion on actual drafts.

The presentations were typically interesting (except the one by IEEE,
which was on the verge of corporate public relations) but were not
really for a RG meeting and, more important, ate 75 % of the meeting
time, which is too much.

I agree that the time division was not ideal yesterday, but I think present=
ations did help our thinking and conversation further (also the observation=
 that other standards bodies approach this problem differently is quite rel=
evant I think, it might mean we're doing something useful).=20

Since we have been running out of time quite consistently in recent meeting=
, it might be a solution to request more time, and then ensure we use a max=
imum of 50% of our time on presentations and at least 50% on discussions an=
d bringing work further?

If people like that idea, I would also be very interested to hear whether p=
eople think it might be useful to do work in other configurations than the =
default (the default being: someone stands in front of the room and present=
 something, and other queue in front of the mic (and most people are glued =
to their screen)). Could we use break-out groups to work on different docum=
ents? Or use break-out groups to discuss different topics with report backs=
 at the end of the session?

Curious to hear your thoughts.=20

Best,

Unfortunately, there was no time to discuss it (see my rant on the use
of meeting time). So, here are my remarks on -00:

* the draft says "This document aims to document forms of protest" but
contains little about protests. It is a very difficult issue and I
don't have an immediate answer but it is certainly something to
address. What is the Internet equivalent of a protest in the streets?
We all (I think) agress that dDoS are NOT this equivalent, and are
something to fight. But then what?  "Blackening" Web sites is a "pull
protest", where you give a message to people who came to search
one. What is possible for a "push protest"?  [Note that it is related
to the problem of the lack of a public space - think streets and
market places - on the Internet.]

* "it also makes it legally and technically very difficult to
communite a message to someone who did not explicitly ask for this"
There is here a difference between the Internet and the meat space. In
the meat space, it is acceptable to "push" messages to people "who did
not explicitly ask for this" because it doesn't scale: Jehovah's
witnesses can bang on your door, to talk about Jesus and it is most of
the time regarded as acceptable (even if annoying) precisely because
it doesn't scale. One Jehovah's witness cannot bang on one million
doors at the same time. So, there is little risk that this freedom to
push messages will be abused. On the Internet, it is the opposite. The
example given in the draft ("a message was distributed to the server
logs of millons of servers through the 'masscan'-tool") is spam, pure
and simple. One person can do it, with very limited resources. If it
were regarded as acceptable, logs would become unusable.

* I think this is a very important issue, when discussing Internet
vs. meatspace. In the meatspace, when you protest, when you push
messages, you commit resources: your time and sometimes, depending
on the country, your physical security. It has two consequences:
protests have meaning (one million people in the street mean
something, politically, while one million bots mean nothing), and the
risk of abuse is limited (you cannot have a one-million-people
demonstration blocking the city center twice a day).

* "a concept that is regularly discussed on the application level,
called 'filter bubble'" I think this concept is seriously exaggerated,
often in anti-Internet propaganda. Before the Internet, people were
already reading only books and newspapers they agree with, only
talking with similar-minded friends, etc. It has nothing new.

* a pre-draft circulated with interesting examples of peer-production
systems, decision-making platforms. These examples are not in -00.  Is
it because it was applications, not infrastructure?

At the plenary, someone said that the IEEE, in one of its working
groups, works on a TLS interception solution. He was not sure it was
was officially adopted by the IEEE or just discussed.

It seems that it is this technical solution:

http://mctls.org/

A perfect example of the things we discuss in HRPC about the
responsability of the engineers. Not only such "solutions" open
possible vulnerabilities in TLS (a protocol which is complicated and
sometimes brittle: changes have unintended consequences), but it is
also easy to see how it could be used for evil.

By the way, this is, in my opinion, what we should do once
draft-ietf-hrpc-research is published: "outreach", go to working
groups, explain them, draw attention to this RFC.

Otherwise, the project risk to be, like the "ethics" project at IEEE,
just a small spot of ethics, disconnected from the main activity.

Does anyone have any ideas about if this is implemented, how widespread, etc?

 At the plenary, someone said that the IEEE, in one of its
 working
 groups, works on a TLS interception solution. He was not
 sure it was
 was officially adopted by the IEEE or just discussed.
 
 It seems that it is this technical solution:
 
 http://mctls.org/
 
 A perfect example of the things we discuss in HRPC about
 the
 responsability of the engineers. Not only such "solutions"
 open
 possible vulnerabilities in TLS (a protocol which is
 complicated and
 sometimes brittle: changes have unintended consequences),
 but it is
 also easy to see how it could be used for evil.

I'm not sure that this was already mentioned by anyone
and I'm sorry if I missed it, but I think this here is highly
interesting and related to the hrpc efforts:

(watch the talk)

Another option might be to have one IETF a year that is more
presentation-heavy and the others that are more like working sessions?

Speaking as a WG chair, not an RG chair. We do indeed have presentations =
in our meetings, but unless it is literally a presentation of someone's =
work, there is a posted internet draft (which we presume people have =
read), the purpose of the presentation is to frame a discussion that we =
need to have, and the intended outcome is an update to the draft. In =
v6ops Wednesday, for example, we had five such discussions, which =
implies 20 minutes each. If you look on the meeting materials site, you =
will see that presentations were mostly pretty short - five or so =
slides, supporting a conversation, and resulted in long lines of people =
approaching the mike to discuss them.
