Dear all,

To test the relevance of the human rights considerations I've asked two
volunteers from the Buenos Aires session to review their IETF Internet
Drafts with these guidelines for human rights considerations in mind.

If there are other authors, editors or working group members that are
working on a draft which they would like to review with these
considerations in mind, that would of course be very welcome. If you'll
do so, I would like to kindly ask you to:

1. Read through the guidelines here:
https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-tenoever-hrpc-research-02#section-5.3.2=


2. Take your draft

3. Make notes about your findings, especially relating the following poin=
ts:
- Relevance of the guidelines for your draft
- Changes you will make to your draft
- Perhaps even a considerations paragraph that could be added to your dra=
ft.

4. Perhaps write a short evaluation paragraph in which you answer the
following questions:
- Was this a useful exercise
- What can be improved?
- Examples
- Number of questions
- Granularity of questions
- Did going through the questionnaire feel like 'time well spent'?

All your thoughts are very welcome.

Best,

Niels

PS If you prefer to talk about this rather than do a write up, am also
more than happy to schedule a call with you.

We'll defintely do so. All review are very much welcomed, we have
already received several recommendations off-list.

As shared yesterday, also tests of the consideration with working drafts
would be very much welcomed.

Best,

Niels

The us of the word 'political' here is quite problematic imo. It is very
hard to delineate what is political and what is not, and as Laura
DeNardis  argues in 'Protocol Politics' (p.6): 'Protocols are
political'. So both saying that the IETF does not make political
statements is I think not consistent with for instance RFC3271, RFC1958,
RFC7258, etc, and 'and we do not choose or not choose venues based on
political criteria' is I think incorrect if you look at the 'principles
of inclusiveness' mentioned further down in the same document.

I like the language as suggested by Robert in line with text on UN
events (http://mirror.unhabitat.org/categories.asp?catid=3D831).

I do think though that this could help us with the ongoing discussion
instead of being a replacement of the previous text:

We *would like* to facilitate the onsite or remote participation of
anyone inclusive and free from any form of discrimination, based on
gender, age, health status, disability, income, nationality, ethnicity,
migratory condition, or political, religious or sexual orientation ,
where all participants are granted equal opportunities to contribute to
the IETF standards making process.

Happy to further discuss.

Best,

Niels

FWIW, I disagree, though this is clearly a thing on which
reasonable folks take different positions.

=46rom my POV, RFC7258 makes technical statements and is one.

RFC7258 is of course also relevant to areas of policy that
are rightly called political, but the text itself is not
well described as a political statement - it's a technical
statement with policy consequences.

To try use an analogy to explain - a document describing
weather patterns ought not be considered political, but
deciding how to deal with global climate change clearly is.
Some IETF documents are like the former. And yes, people
doing politics will refer to and use those according to
their political inclinations but that does not make a
set of barometer readings a political statement. Printing
those out and nailing them to a door however, might be
one.

Hi Stephen,

I can draft several responses to this, but to ensure I understand you
correctly, do you also think that RFC3271 and RFC1958 don't make
political statements?

Best,

Niels

I'd have to re-read 'em to say really but on 1st glance no.
Seems fairly clear for 1958, for 3271 that seems like a
bit of aspirational writing. While I guess one might consider
3271 more political than other things, I'm also fine that
there may be exceptions in the nearly 8000 RFCs issued but
I do not accept that one can go from there to saying that
the IETF makes political statements. (And those are old
too.)

Thanks Stephen,

Unfortunately I have to disagree. I think the process in the IETF and
statements that are made in RFCs are highly political. Because, and let
me quote Laura DeNardis here:

[Protocols] control the glbal flow of information and make decisions
that influence access to knowledge, civil liberties online, innovation
policy, national economic competetiveness, national security, and which
technology companies will succeed.

So this goes far beyond aspirational quotes imho.

Best,

Niels

That's fine.

Yes, the process is political because it involves humans,
sure. That does not mean the output of the process is
well described as political statements. University politics
is notoriously political, but most academic publication is
not.

> statements that are made in RFCs are highly political.

Fully disagree. Almost all RFC text is dry old technical crap.
The little that is not, is almost-all technical with policy
implications like 7258. "Highly political" is just not in
any universe an accurate description of the RFC series.

I don't agree with that either, but there's a lot of subtlty
as to who controls what when real networks are considered.
The idea that some RFC describing a DHCP option is therefore
definitely political is, to me, nonsense.

Hmm,

RFC7258 is predominantly technical criteria for protocols, but does
take a specific stance regarding tradeoffs of various =E2=80=9Cpublic =
policy=E2=80=9D/
civic norms and standards - i.e. the conclusion that the inability to
distinguish =E2=80=9Clegitimate=E2=80=9D from "non-legitimate" pervasive =
monitoring
(PM) actors requires that all PM be considered considered an
=E2=80=9Cattack=E2=80=9D and mitigated against during protocol design.

This taking of a particular stance regarding appropriate tradeoffs
of civic norms and standards would traditionally called 'taking a
political position=E2=80=99, even if doing so via technical criteria =
statements.

Note - there is not anything inherently wrong with enshrining specific
tradeoffs in civic values in protocol design (and in fact, it may not be
humanly possible to design reasonable protocols which otherwise
attempt to accommodate a diverse range of value tradeoffs), but the
IETF should probably take extra care to utilize a very well publicized
and overly inclusive process when in undertakes such activities.

Frankly, I don't see what other conclusion could be reached.
One could I guess question the premise that those things are
not distinguishable, but a) I don't think that's really
credible, and b) I don't recall anyone actually making a
real case that distinction is technically feasible (but there
was a *lot* of discussion... see below;-)

So no I don't accept that that conclusion is political in
itself. I do accept that some people consider it so, but
you'll have to explain to me where the politics enters in
between the premise and the conclusion.

I fully agree that extra care needs to be taken with things like
7258. That did happen though - we had a tech plenary on the topic
in Vancouver and setup a mailing list and had about 1000 mails on
ietf@ietf.org during an extended IETF LC that lasted a couple of
months iirc. There was a similar kind of consideration for 2804
as well, so overall I think the IETF handles these kinds of things
fairly well when they come up.

Cheers,
S.

Stephen - Did any of the governments that participated in the discussion

I won=E2=80=99t debate the merits of the term =E2=80=9Cpolitical=E2=80=9D,=

I apparently was misunderstood - by =E2=80=9Cinclusive", I meant with =
specific
outreach to other potentially affected stakeholders who might otherwise
be unaware of the public policy discussion going on at the IETF.   (For
example, each of the RIRs has government working groups which help
governments be aware of, and engage with, the various ongoing registry
policy discussions in each region.)   Did the IETF reach out to any of
various government associations (or perhaps to the Government
Advisory Committee in ICANN) to appraise of them of the activity?

Interestingly enough, I don=E2=80=99t see RFC 7844 as taking a public =
policy position
(at least as far as I can tell), as all it is doing is providing option =
that would allow
DHCP clients an anonymous profile.  This doesn=E2=80=99t remove any =
choices or force
any outcome, but simply provides an options for those who desire such.  =
Users
who value such can use it, governments who feel it is not appropriate =
can pass
laws forbidden its use, etc. =20

If the IETF were to take the stance that use of the anonymous profile =
were required,
then that certainly would be taking a particular public policy stance, =
since there is
no meaningful way to work around such a standards result.  Given the =
popularity=20
of the Internet protocol suite (with near ubiquitous acceptance =
globally), the IETF=20
needs to take particular care when it enshrines tradeoffs on public =
policy matters=20
via mandatory protocol specification. =20

Actually, this was the state before RFC 7844 which was a policy
position: because there was no standard way to have "anonymity" with
DHCP, people were *forced* to reveal things about themselves (there
were even some data-leaking options which were mandatory, see RFC
4361, section 6.1, which made option "client identifier" compulsory).

So, it is a nice example of how code embodies political positions.

See also RFC 7819 and RFC 7824 for an analysis of the problem.

Well I've no idea which IETF participants do or do not reflect
what government positions. As you know, that's not how the IETF
works. (If you want to change that, that's a different discussion.)

But that is not the issue raised. RFC7258 is silent about
that iirc. The IETF neither "allows" nor "disallows" PM.

The issue raised here is whether or not there is some political
element to the technical consequences of the indistinguishability
between different motives for PM. I still don't see that
there is.

We don't do that no. But was that possibly a rhetorical
question like this one? :-)

If you want to propose that the IETF ought formally do such
things, then feel free... but I suspect you already know how
major a change that'd represent and how difficult it would be
to get such a change. (And as it happens, I'm fairly sure I'd
personally prefer how the IETF is setup today to the kind of
thing that I think would be necessary for such formal
consultation with governments or companies to be part of IETF
process.)

as an attack, and set the requirement for protocol developers to work =
towards
mitigation of same.  The reasoning behind such a position doesn=E2=80=99t =
alter the
fact that the position embeds a certain public policy position - =
specifically,
that the mitigation is necessary despite implications for lawful PM.

I actually think that RFC7258 outcome is the correct one, but to take =
such a
position without clearly documenting the fact that technical =
accommodation
of =E2=80=9Clegitimate=E2=80=9D PM wasn=E2=80=99t feasible (as well as =
the actual reasoning why the
public policy tradeoff is reasonable) doesn=E2=80=99t make for an easily =

Acknowledged that you do not, and I perhaps am insufficiently clear in =
my
explanation to be much help in this regard.

It=E2=80=99s probably unnecessary (unless the IETF intends to mandate =
additional
public policy positions via its standards activities.)  That is clearly =
germane
to the discussion of HRPC work direction and modes of operation.

You state =E2=80=9Cformal consultation=E2=80=9D, whereas I was very =
careful to use the term
=E2=80=9Coutreach=E2=80=9D=E2=80=A6  there is a huge difference between =
the two - the former involves
seeking a specific position from another body, the latter (outreach) =
simply
means making an effort to notify another party that you are now =
undertaking
work in given area, and that they can participate (or not) in the =
IETF=E2=80=99s work
as they choose.

That's fair.

In the case in question, there was sufficient publicity
about it that I don't think there was a real problem with
that. (There is an ongoing issue about how entities like
governments can usefully take part as IETF participants
but that's yet another issue.)

Cheers,

My 2 cents:

The IETF WGs take decisions based on technical arguments. At some point, =
some internal politics may be involved, but the process in the IETF is =
designed such that this is minimised as much as possible. How operators =
and administrators deal with the outcome of the IETF process is not up =
to the IETF.

Avri -

I believe that Niels raised a valid question about whether "the IETF =
does not
make political statements=94 is consistent with RFC7258 (et al)

Depending on the resolution of that question, one can expect very =

imagine different outcomes of the HRPC work depending on the answer.

To elaborate for clarity, consider the following text in the "Charter of =
Human Rights
and Principles for the Internet=94 (produced by "Internet Rights and =
Principles Dynamic
Coalition=94 (available here: =

PC_english_4thedition.pdf>>)

> "As enshrined in Article 3 of the UDHR: "everyone has the right to =
life, liberty and security of person".
> All security measures must be consistent with international human =
rights law and standards. This means that security measures will be =
illegal where they restrict another human right (for example the right =
to privacy or the right to freedom of expression) except for in =

defined. All restrictions must be the minimum necessary to meet a =
genuine need which is recognized as legal under International law, and =

>=20
i.e. application of the principles in cases where there are overlapping =

Speaking for myself alone.

I think an important consideration in that is the definition of an =
"attack", noted in the third and fourth paragraphs of section 1. As =
noted there,

   The term "attack" is used here in a technical sense that differs
   somewhat from common English usage.  In common English usage, an
   attack is an aggressive action perpetrated by an opponent, intended
   to enforce the opponent's will on the attacked party.  The term is
   used here to refer to behavior that subverts the intent of
   communicating parties without the agreement of those parties.  An
   attack may change the content of the communication, record the
   content or external characteristics of the communication, or through
   correlation with other communication events, reveal information the
   parties did not intend to be revealed.  It may also have other
   effects that similarly subvert the intent of a communicator.
   [RFC4949] contains a more complete definition for the term "attack".
   We also use the term in the singular here, even though PM in reality
   may consist of a multifaceted set of coordinated attacks.

   In particular, the term "attack", used technically, implies nothing
   about the motivation of the actor mounting the attack.  The
   motivation for PM can range from non-targeted nation-state
   surveillance, to legal but privacy-unfriendly purposes by commercial
   enterprises, to illegal actions by criminals.

No, that's not a political statement. It is a technically accurate =
statement about pervasive monitoring. One variation on Pervasive =
Monitoring is carried out by web sites that measure their user's =
behavior with a view to advertising to them; the users increasingly =
respond by blocking adware and tracking attempts. Another form, had =
Apple (in this case) succumbed to subpoenas, is the issue of "storing =
one's data in the cloud". If the cloud can now be coerced to turn that =
data over to a third party, whether law enforcement or organized crime, =
or hacked to deliver the contents to some other country, the service =
itself becomes a disservice, and - well, how many people trusted the =
Office of Personnel Management with classified security records related =
to personnel, and how many of them do now? And oh yes, let's discuss NSA =
and CBHQ. Several articles assert that people posting on Facebook and =
other sites have become measurably more "conservative in what they =
send".

Pervasive monitoring is an attack in the technical sense that it =
subverts the user's intent regarding their data, regardless of who the =
user is, and regardless of who is monitoring them.

That has nothing to do with the mtgvenue document, which is about venue =
selection and the pressures sometimes placed on IETF leadership to =
support the politics of someone in the country being visited, or to =
comment on laws in that country, whether enforced or otherwise.

The political statement it makes is that the ability of two parties to =

I think that's a poor metaphor; weather patterns are documenting =
something that occurs (sometimes naturally, sometimes manmade); the =
document *describes* the weather patterns, it does not define them. IETF =
documents (at least good ones) document protocols that are agreed to by =

admit so.

The political statement starts two lines further down in the document -

  "The same techniques to achieve PM can be used regardless of =

i.e. the characterization of PM as an =93attack=94 is predicated on the =
fact that
_defense against nefarious actors_ takes precedence over any possible
legal use of PM (even to the point of not bothering to consider if =
support
of legal PM was technically possible.)

The IETF made a determination that its protocols should mitigate against
=93legal=94 pervasive monitoring, without bothering to even consider if =
such
activities might be accommodated.  This is actually quite a commendable
position, but involves making a determination of the =93right" _public =
policy_
tradeoff (of privacy and security over support for the any perceived or
potential legal requirements for PM) - i.e. a public policy =
determination
being made by the IETF for all  Internet users; the political stance =
then
enables the establishment of technical requirements contained in the
document.

As a thought exercise, consider what the IETF would have produced if it
had took a purely technical approach to the problem - it could have done
a detailed analysis that indicated that is not feasible to somehow =
provide
for collection of PM data and "exceptional access=94 to the resulting =
data
for those who might have valid legal need - ergo, PM cannot be safely

We
only got the final result, without any documented analysis of the public

I'll grant you at least some of that. Speaking from personal experience =
(RFC 3924), though, I think I have already been through the analysis. =
Lawfully Authorized Electronic Surveillance, aka Lawful Intercept, is an =
active attack in the sense that a probe of some sort is inserted into =
the network to monitor the communications of a party that uses it. It is =
presumably sanctioned by a legal procedure that recognizes that it is =
what Isaih would call our "strange work". My company addressed the issue =
because we were in effect required to; our customers were required to =
have a solution, and we are/were their vendor. In the analysis, the =
simplest and cheapest thing to do was split them cable and run one end =
to law enforcement. We were concerned about the issues (which came up in =
Greece in 2002, and with LAPD at least twice in the mid 1990's) of a =
party not lawfully authorized to use the capability gaining access to =
it. Our solution was auditing of the capability; if organized crime =
leaned on a public official or a back door was activated, we would at =
least know how and when it happened.

The issue that RFC 7258 responds to is activities claimed to be =
legal/authorized, but making no sense under a "reasonable man's" =
interpretation of the Constitution or US Law. One example, finding that =
Google had what amounts to a split data center, the two halves connected =
via an undersea cable, and tapping the cable in order to insert a tap =
*inside* the company. You have followed the media as much or more than I =
have, so you know what I refer to. An audit trail isn't going to fix an =
overt miscarriage of jurisprudence such as that. =46rom my perception, =
if we're dealing with a party that will analyze and overcome any =
reasonable technical obstacle we set up, technology isn't the solution. =
Yes, we recommend encryption in any and every case that it makes =
economic sense. But ultimately someone needs to say "enough!".

RFC 7258 is the IETF's way of saying "enough". You're correct that we =
didn't go through all of the hoops we do with technology problems, but I =
actually think we correctly recognized that this was not a technology =
problem, nor was it solvable by technology. And if that's political, so =
be it.

But that has nothing to do with venue selection, which is the context of =
the statement being quoted on hrpc.

Agreed. Now and then the IETF does have discussions where someone
says "that's just politics and we don't/shouldn't do that" and if
we had a thread (or something) to point at with a calm discussion
of just that it might be useful. That said, I'm not sure that hrpc
is exactly the right venue for that discussion, (not all political
things being about human rights) but I can't think of a better one
either so...

I don't think that characterisation of 7258 is quite right, and
in a way that affects the conclusion that you say many people
may reach. (I do agree with you that some folks do reach that
conclusion, but I think they're mistaken.)

7258 is not about two parties, it is about pervasive monitoring
of many parties in many places (physical & topological) over
extended durations. And I think 7258 does make the technical
case for why PM is an attack. I won't repeat the arguments here,
but some of that is not about privacy, but more about security.

7258 does not actually say that privacy is more important than
anyone's ability to monitor one connection between two parties.
And I think that is correct - I don't think there is a credible
purely technical justification for such an unqualified statement
about two parties and privacy trumping all monitoring.

That said, I'm personally in favour of IETF technologies being as
privacy-friendly as is pragmatically possible, so that implementers
and those-deploying get the choice to be privacy-friendly and aren't
forced to use protocols that prevent them from doing so. But I don't
claim that we have a documented IETF consensus that goes quite that
far. (I'd guess we might be able to reach consensus something along
those lines though.)

Is my position there political or technical? I guess I'd say it's a
technical argument, but others might disagree. And of course that's
not easy to figure out as many IETF participants are clever folk
who are well able to construct a good technical argument for what
they want, regardless of whether their motivation is commercial,
technical or political. I think it's good that we don't argue
about folks' motivations but about their technical arguments, so
I'm not too bothered that we can't always tell why someone is
making an argument. (Maybe taking that attitude is a political
statement though;-)

I agree with the two paragraphs above.

Fair enough, all analogies are misleading in some respect.

What I was trying to get to was a difference between an RFC that
has policy implications and the later use of that RFC in political
argument. Just because the latter happens does not mean that the
RFC is itself a political statement. So for example, I don't think
7258 is a political statement, but if someone printed it out and
nailed it to the door of Fort Meade, that latter act would be a
clearly political statement I reckon.

In the case of 7258, (and 2804 iirc) part of the discussion did
explicitly consider that the eventual RFC would likely be used in
such political argument and we did make some text changes to try
ensure that was less likely to be misinformed but I still don't
consider that making a political statement, rather we were trying
to make the technical statement in a way that would hopefully lead
to less confusion later.

Cheers,
S.

RFC7258 makes a well reasoned argument that the actions required to
conduct PM are indistinguishable regardless of motivation or legality,  =
and
that therefore defense against nefarious PM actors by the IETF requires
that PM be mitigated in general.   (I=E2=80=99ll avoid using the word =
=E2=80=9Cattack=E2=80=9D at all,
since the RFC redefines that word from its common usage.)

The technical analysis of whether it is possible to make legal PM =
somehow
distinguishable is absent.  The technical analysis of whether protocols =
could
reasonably be augmented to collect =E2=80=9Clegal=E2=80=9D monitoring =

public policy requirements that involves pervasive monitoring, it would =

these
can=E2=80=99t be accommodated and hence will be mitigated along with =

Agreed, but the present doc doesn=E2=80=99t really provide any technical =
analysis
regarding why it is not technically possible to provide =E2=80=9Clegal=E2=80=
=9D PM; it is more
of a footnote to the effect that presently it can=E2=80=99t be =
distinguished so it will
be have to be mitigated as well.   Since there was no consideration of =
how
to deal with the requirement of legal PM (not even a note to the effect =
that
it would be technically very complex to provide such), you really =
shouldn=E2=80=99t
be surprised by characterization that the document takes a political =
position.

Hi,

The Mission of the IETF makes clear that from time to time we may need
to make political statements in support of that mission.  The question
here is whether making statements or inserting selection criteria about
venues supports the mission of the IETF.  The risk is that going beyond
the mission will trade off assets and effort against it.  To draw this
starkly, does the IETF want to be viewed as a global standards
organization or a human rights organization?  All of this applies to the
iEtf and not the iRtf.  This RG has for more latitude to explore human
rights and their relationship to the IETF's work (or for that matter
other SDOs- as an aside, it would be helpful if any output were more
generally applicable).

The challenge for this research group is to find ways for us to act
ethically in fulfilling the mission, or failing that, explain what we
need to do to change that mission.  draft-tenoever-hprc-research-02
provides an evaluation of our protocol stack on the basis of human
rights.  The chartering of the RG all but demands such a draft.

This having been said, I find something troubling in the document.  It
seems to cover SOME human rights and not others.  The rights in the UDHR
themselves conflict, and I would expect that conflict to be reflected.=20
For example, while the document spends a substantial amount of time on
privacy and freedom of expression, it spends considerably less time on
the basic rights to life, liberty, and security of the person (Article 3
of the UDHR).  What does "security of the person" mean in the context of
our protocol work, and how does it interact the right to freedom of
opinion and expression (Article 19) in the context of our protocol work?

That is something I would expect to see, and I very much doubt that
there will be black and white answers.

Eliot

    <p>Hi,</p>
    <p>The Mission of the IETF makes clear that from time to time we may
      need to make political statements in support of that mission.=C2=A0=
 The
      question here is whether making statements or inserting selection
      criteria about venues supports the mission of the IETF.=C2=A0 The r=
isk
      is that going beyond the mission will trade off assets and effort
      against it.=C2=A0 To draw this starkly, does the IETF want to be vi=
ewed
      as a global standards organization or a human rights
      organization?=C2=A0 All of this applies to the iEtf and not the iRt=
f.=C2=A0
      This RG has for more latitude to explore human rights and their
      relationship to the IETF's work (or for that matter other SDOs- as
      an aside, it would be helpful if any output were more generally
      applicable).<br>
    </p>
    <p>The challenge for this research group is to find ways for us to
      act ethically in fulfilling the mission, or failing that, explain
      what we need to do to change that mission.=C2=A0
      draft-tenoever-hprc-research-02 provides an evaluation of our
      protocol stack on the basis of human rights.=C2=A0 The chartering o=
f
      the RG all but demands such a draft.</p>
    <p>This having been said, I find something troubling in the
      document.=C2=A0 It seems to cover SOME human rights and not others.=
=C2=A0
      The rights in the UDHR themselves conflict, and I would expect
      that conflict to be reflected.=C2=A0 For example, while the documen=
t
      spends a substantial amount of time on privacy and freedom of
      expression, it spends considerably less time on the basic rights
      to life, liberty, and security of the person (Article 3 of the
      UDHR).=C2=A0 What does "security of the person" mean in the context=
 of
      our protocol work, and how does it interact the right to freedom
      of opinion and expression (Article 19) in the context of our
      protocol work?</p>
    <p>That is something I would expect to see, and I very much doubt
      that there will be black and white answers.</p>

RFC7258 makes a well reasoned argument that the actions required to

that PM be mitigated in general.   (I=E2=80=99ll avoid using the word =E2=

since the RFC redefines that word from its common usage.)

The technical analysis of whether it is possible to make legal PM somehow=

not easy to figure out as many IETF participants are clever folk

I find that argument utterly unconvincing. 7258 is not the place to
provide a non-existence proof against the kind of magical thinking
that would be necessary to defend "good" PM as distinguishable from
"bad" PM (for any definitions of good or bad).

Also, I've no clue what you mean by "legal PM."

I never said I was surprised:-)

FWIW my sense of where you're coming from is that perhaps what you're
saying is that anything we know is likely to be interpreted as a
political statement (in this case by those who do PM, or perhaps PM
or LI) itself then becomes a political statement.

Is that in the ballpark? (If so then I of course also reject that
idea, but I'd then understand more about where we're not on the same
page.)

Cheers,
S.

Really?  I believe you rely upon that very inability to distinguish them =
in order to
come to the technical conclusion that all PM must be treated as an =
attack and
possibility for mitigation considered during protocol design.

Either you=E2=80=99re relying on that completely undocumented technical =
constraint, or
you have dismissed the requirement for legal PM entirely out of the very =
realistic
public policy issues that it poses.  It appears the latter, and thus I =
recommended
that cases where public policy positions are taken be more clearly =
called out in
future IETF documents.

> Also, I've no clue what you mean by "legal PM.=E2=80=9D

See RFC7258 - "=E2=80=A6 PM can range from non-targeted nation-state =
surveillance,
to legal but privacy-unfriendly purposes=E2=80=9D

Not at all - I=E2=80=99m saying that you=E2=80=99ve ruled out any =
possibility of PM for =E2=80=9Clegal
but privacy-unfriendly purposes=E2=80=9D without showing why that result =
is the only
viable technical outcome, so the result isn=E2=80=99t a technical =
conclusion but based
on some =E2=80=9Cdesirable" public policy result.  Again, it=E2=80=99s =
probably a very useful
result for maintaining a globally interconnected and secure Internet, so =
long
as the IETF makes it plain during development that it is undertaking =
public
policy.

Yes. What's utterly unconvincing is your argument that the lack of a

Stephen -

RFC7258 provides a particular direction for IETF protocol developers -
direction which will, over time, hinder/limit/preclude use of PM for =
legal
purposes.  Absent technical explanation of why that outcome is =
necessary,
it actually is a statement which takes a public policy position.   =
Frankly, it
is a valuable service to the Internet community for the IETF to make =
such
a clear policy statement, but definitely needs to be done explicitly and =
with
corresponding outreach if one wants a multistakeholder result (e.g. a =
final
outcome which governments understand and support, rather than subvert
due to lack of investment in the process.)

IETF protocol engineers should not have to work on protocols that have
objectionable elements, particularly when such elements hinder the =
growth
and security of the global Internet.   It is reasonable for the IETF to =
state
whatever norms and values it feels are necessary for a successful =
Internet,
but such statements are not technical if they preclude one alternative =
over
another while lacking technical justification for why it must be that =
way.
This is the case with RFC7258, and we=E2=80=99re likely to experience =
the same
difficultly is highly likely to occur when considering protocol =
considerations
necessary for supporting human rights, so it would be best if the scope =
of
the WG activity made plain whether taking specific public policy =
positions
is in scope.

Hi,

A cautionary note: we seem to be arguing over an RFC that has been out
for quite some time, and cannot change.  What may be getting lost is the
principles.  With that in mind, please see below.

Whether 7258 is political is not the right question, because the readers
gets to decide that matter, not the authors.  The important question is
whether 7258 is supports the mission of the IETF in some way.  If we
choose to publish a document, regardless of how people view it, we will
have credibility with the broader community if we support it with strong
technical underpinnings.  References are a good means to provide that
support, and they add to transparency regarding our decision making
process.  And I would add that if one of your students made an
unsupported assertion in an academic paper, you might well mark her or
him down for it, regardless of whether the assertion was political.

Eliot

Yes, hopefully so.

Yes, we disagree about that. I think 7258 provides sufficient
and appropriate detail (which is mostly to omit detail).

But generalising away from 7258 - is it your contention that
unless relevant RFCs contain all detail of everything fully laid
out and justified (via included text or by reference) that they are
then political statements? I don't think that's at all credible as
it would call for all such RFCs to be written as precisely as a
PhD thesis, which is not appropriate IMO.

As an IRTF RG I think comment on HR aspects of IETF processes is
in scope. Changing those processes is not in scope here.

It is the question that was asked however. And while it may not be
the best question, it gets asked from time to time about various
things, and I think it'd be an improvement if we had some better
clarity about what that question might mean and what answers might
make sense.

Well no, as I said in my response to John, RFCs are not PhD theses.
They need to be correct, but don't require the same level of precision
in how every statement is justified.

Yes, while I do believe it would be possible to guide future protocol
developers to somehow allow =E2=80=9Clegal PM=E2=80=9D, it is unclear if =
that could
be accomplished in any meaningfully secure manner; it is unlikely
that the capability would be useful in criminal matters (since criminals
would simply disable or use something else); and there exists a very
large probability of misuse of the =E2=80=9Cexceptional access=E2=80=9D =
that would be
provided to the PM data/collection mechanism.

Of course, nearly all of the above is a political statement - a =
particular
position on public policy matters based on what I happen to feel is =
best=E2=80=A6
There=E2=80=99s nothing wrong with that as a basis for recommendation to =
all
IETF protocol developers, but if that=E2=80=99s the reason, it deserves =
to be
stated as such.

Agreed, but for those situations where the IETF decides to guide all =
future
protocol developers with regards to a particular architectural approach =
that
will mandate specific public policy outcomes for the all Internet =
protocols to
come, then it is quite important to either clearly state the public =
policy goals
which drive the recommendation, or to clearly demonstrate why there is =
only
one technical approach available.

I think we're getting repetitive so I'll let others chime in

I'm afraid I still disagree. It may not have all the argument
in that paragraph but that does not make it a political
statement.

The problem is that it really is open to the interpretation of the

As I understand it one of the reasons for going to DOIs for RFCs was so
that academics could more easily receive publication credit.  If the
quality of the work doesn't warrant that recognition, a DOI isn't going
to save us.

It is a political claim when you state it in explicitly political
terms, perhaps.  But the very same propositional content can be made
entirely neutrally about the technology:

    The problem with attempting to distinguish desirable monitoring
    from undesirable monitoring in a network of networks is
    fundamentally technological.  In a network of networks, the end
    points and possibly some of the intermediate connecting systems
    are controlled by the very targets of monitoring.  Those end
    points are in a position to choose the mechanisms for and
    configurations of communications between them.  Therefore, any
    system that did not wish to be monitored would not use the
    monitorable technology.  Moreover, an attacker on the network who
    wanted to monitor traffic without authorization would simply
    pretend to be an authorized monitor.  By implication, then, if it
    is desirable that communications must sometimes not be monitorable
    by an unauthorized third party, then the capability to foil such
    monitoring must be available.  If it is available, there is no
    reason to suppose it would not be in use all the time.  Therefore,
    distinguishing between desirable and undesirable monitoring in the
    network is futile.

None of that is about politics.  It is about the simple entailments
given a set of assumptions about the technology.  You might argue that
the result of this will be to push governments against the idea of a
network of networks.  And that may be, but that result does not make
the above political.  It just makes it an inconvenient truth for some
people.

Best regards,

A

So what's the consequence of that position? Is it that the
IETF cannot make "political statements" because only readers
decide what is or is not one such? I'd find that a bit hard
to accept, and would be surprised if that were your conclusion.

I don't think mechanisms for referencing have anything to do
with the requirements for the precision of text in RFCs, nor
does academic credit. And neither is anything to do with the
question at hand. But in any case yes, DOIs won't save us:-)

Taken with what I wrote earlier, the consequence of that position is
that the IETF SHOULD makes "political statements" (for whatever
definition) when they support the mission of the organization, and they
SHOULD NOT make "political statements" (for whatever definition) when
they would be outside that mission.  That is why I feel quite
comfortable supporting 7258.  While one might quibble over the word
"secure" (and I have), clearly an unauthorized individual reading
content they shouldn't have access to has to fall outside that
category.  Is that a political statement?  My answer: who cares?  It was
necessary to guide development of IETF protocol specifications.

Again, this is relevant to this RG because it can provide bounds as to
how far to go with recommendations for the IETF.

You are missing my point: Heather is working hard to see that the work
can be cited for academic credit, and you are essentially saying that
the standard of an RFC should be below the level that academics use.=20
That's a conflict.

Putting that aside, I just flat out disagree with you that the
referencing standard for an RFC should lower than an academic paper.=20
Again, doubly so when we are not solidly within the scope of the
organization, but somewhere in a grey area.

Fair enough. It's probably not productive to focus too much on 7258.=20

To me, the interesting question is how we determine the goals for a =
protocol; how much value it should place upon privacy, ability for =
authorities to intermediate, etc.

In some cases, there is precedence to guide us. In Honolulu, we didn't =
allow an on-path intermediary to insert itself into TLS for HTTP, =
despite the fervent wishes of some members of the community, because the =
HTTPS URL scheme is explicated defined as end-to-end, and so it would =
violate the reasonable expectations of current users of the protocol. =
Personally, I'd like that principle -- that you can't change protocols =
in a way that seriously violates the reasonable expectations of current =
users -- clearly enshrined (and there *is* technical justification for =
it, in a way; it's just a form of clear versioning).

In other cases, it's less clear. If someone brings the Foo Protocol to =
us and it allows a government to insert itself in its citizens' =
communication (their consent is assumed by using the protocol), should =
we reject it? Upon what rationale?=20

If Bar Protocol is then designed to frustrate employers, schools, =
prisons and governments from knowing anything about what's happening, =
I'm imagining it will have many supporters, but if we've previously =
rejected Foo, accepting Bar will be seen by many as a political =
statement. Again, that might be the right thing to do, but we'd better =
be prepared for the repercussions.

=46rom more personal experience, the "safe" hint for HTTP was designed =
to give end users (or their parents) easier control over the content =
they were exposed to online, but one of the objections that came up in =
IESG discussion was that this might have a secondary effect of =
increasing censorship (the exact mechanism posited is still not =
convincing to me). Regardless of how you feel about that, however, upon =
what basis do we make such judgements?

Cheers,

So how long before the spammers, errr excuse me, the Direct Marketing
Association and similar -- you know, the folks who kept showing up
before Congress during the debates about CAN-SPAM trying to "loosen"
provisions in favor of email advertisers -- and succeeding in some
cases -- show up or pull the IETF into court or hearings over RFCs
which they claim violate 7258 inter alia?

   https://thedma.org/

I know, now you want to argue the case with me, you want to say it's
all voluntary, We Have Heard All That 10,000 Times Before! Save your
bits.

A court, or even congress, or the EU, etc, may not accept that easy
prestidigitation which plays so well to the amen chorus.

Be careful what you wish for.

This all requires a lot more study and wisdom than I'm seeing in this
discussion. It's all so...blue-sky: So long as those present get to
define how the world works this is all reasonable discourse.

Why not at least get some voices with a likely very different PoV into
the discussion. Perhaps DMA counsels and lobbyists, big data miners,
US DoJ, NYC DA Cyrus Vance, Jr -- he's been very outspoken on
cryptography issues, FBI's Comey also, this isn't that (crypto) per se
but I'd imagine they could muster an opinion on "PM" RFCs, KSA, Iran,
China, RU, India, Turkey, etc. etc. Maybe even some respectable big
thinkers (int'l law professors, ethicists, etc.)

Not to give them a "vote" (I know I know) per se but to invite some
more varied viewpoints.

I just get the feeling this can all backfire big-time.

Sure, these are good questions to explore. I'm sure I don't
have the good answers they deserve tbh.

Right. Another aspect of that is that many of the proposals
for TLS MitM involve taking a two party protocol (not counting
CAs for the moment) and try turn it into a 3 party protocol,
which is a very different beast security-wise and in many other
respects. So as you say, radical changes to the existing
semantics is often a good reason to reject a proposed change.

Yeah, those can be tricky and I'm not sure how we generalise.

I just re-read the IESG comments on that. [1] Those are kind of
all over the map really, as I think was the IETF LC (I didn't go
look back at that). Perhaps that is good evidence that we're
operating in a half-understood space when it comes to issues related
to privacy impacts, not sure.

Anyway, I'll need to ponder all of the above some more before
I'd be confident in attempting real answers.

Cheers,

So your take then is more like "I know it when I see it, and
that's a good enough definition"? That's consistent and maybe as
good as we'll get perhaps but it'd mean that there's no generic
way we can help the discussion if someone claims some draft is
"just political" and hence oughtn't be published as an RFC.

I think "RFCs as (sort of) academic publications" is a side discussion
and probably distracting, but it's just not the case that RFCs
need to the same as academic publications. If they were the same
90% of RFCs would be claiming to be better than anything that
went before for example:-) My point was only that I don't find

I wouldn't put it that way.  While perhaps an imperfect analogy, another
way of looking at this is the BoF question from RFC 5434:

>       - there is a problem that needs solving, and the IETF is the righ=
t

And so what does it mean for the IETF to be the right group to address
anything?  That is where our mission comes in.=20

And so there are really two questions:

  * Whether the IETF says anything at all on a subject; and
  * While doing work we've agreed to do, what are the ethical
    implications of design choices?

The first question, I would argue, is relatively straight forward.=20
There are relatively few instances in which there are gray areas.=20
Nobody comes to us for arms control treaties or to settle territorial
disputes, nor should they, nor should we go there as we lack any
competence at addressing such matters, and it is not clear whether our
decision process of rough consensus would be appropriate in those
cases.  Our mission scopes the work of the IETF as I previously
described, for which our decision process is appropriate and where we do
have competence.

What's more, quite frankly companies won't spend money to send
individuals to IETF meetings if they think that there is little
likelihood of getting work accepted.  That's called a bad investment.=20
As we veer from the mission, those who seek to accomplish it will take
their business elsewhere.  We are not human rights experts even though
we as individuals have ethical responsibilities regarding human rights.=20
Even if we adopt a code of conduct such as ISOC's [1], that is a
personal code, and must let people answer those questions for themselves
in as much as many technologies are used to serve both good and ill.

The point is that "lack of detail" =3D> "unsupported", and when we are
outside our core mission, then why would our unsupported assertions be
valued above other's?

Dear all,

Today UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression David Kaye published
his report on the ICT sector and freedom of expression.

http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/FreedomOpinion/Pages/Privatesectorinthedigit=
alage.aspx

The special rapporteur has noticed the work of the HRPC group (see footnote
17). It might be interesting to discuss some of his findings here.

Happy reading!

Hi all,

In response to the report I wrote a quick blogpost here:

https://hrpc.io/united-nations-special-rapporteur-calls-upon-ietf-to-assu=
me-its-responsibility-to-respect-human-rights/

If others are interested to write a blogpost for hrpc.io they're of
course more than welcome to do so!

Best,

Niels

Apologies, hit send too quickly. I'm wondering if there is any good example
of a protocol enabling effective HR violation remedy. The only thing I can
think of would be proposals to tag flows or origins with some identifier
for use in levying complaints. That seems to compromise other important
human rights that seem more foundational than remedy.

A late comment here: a number of us would question if any PM could be
legal... this is something about which many of us in civil society disagree
with our own and other governments. Anyway, not sure I have much more to
add other than to agree this RG is a good place to have discussions but we
do want to make sure feedback about mtgvenue makes it back to that list

Yes, jurisdiction is IMO the key problem that needs solving. I don't
however think that solving that problem involves the IETF much.

While the Internet has hugely increased the number of, and importance
of, events for which it's hard to identify who has jurisdiction, I
think the solutions for that can only be worked out by governments.

And while many governments might initially take a stance that their
own laws cover the entire Internet, I can't see that lasting too long
(i.e. maybe a decade or two) and eventually most governments will have
to figure out ways in which they somehow share jurisdiction in some
sense. (I've no clue how they might do that myself though.)

All that the technical community, of which the IRTF/IETF is a part,
can do as part of that is explain the real complexities involved,
which of course change a lot as we innovate and e.g. do better with
protecting security and privacy in ways that partly conflict with
what LEA see as requirements they need to meet within their specific
jurisdictions. It's a very non-trivial problem.

How do you know that last bit? I read your mail in .ie and had it
been defamatory I might have decided to sue you in .uk :-)

I=E2=80=99m sorry - I was imprecise=E2=80=A6  I did not mean to imply =
that jurisdiction in
cyberspace is a problem that IETF needs to solve; only that the IETF
needs to be consciously aware that the protocol considerations that it
does decide to undertake can have a direct impact on the ability for
governments to support other human rights, such as due process and
redress for violation of personal security.

That certainly is a possible outcome, and the IETF can decide to =
prioritize
human rights considerations in protocols so that such an outcome is the
only technically feasible way forward=E2=80=A6  selecting such an =
approach, rather
than including other human rights as considerations for Internet =
protocols
is effectively a public policy decision.   Governments are generally =
very
poorly equipped to describe their technical requirements - they are not
Internet protocol engineers (and thus tend to miss the mark when they
even attempt such (e.g. key escrow/expectational access)   The IETF is
under no obligation to consider their requirements when setting =
technical
considerations to support human rights, but if it only supports a subset =
of
human rights in such considerations, then it is making a clear statement
about how the tradeoff between various human rights should be balanced
on the Internet.

Not the only thing - explaining the complexities involved is certainly =
one
option, another is outreach so that there is a better understanding =
their
technical requirements is another, actively incorporating those =
requirements
into Internet protocol design is yet another.   There is no right =
approach,
but please don=E2=80=99t whine when governments decide on other =
mechanisms,
if you choose a low-engagement approach.

The IETF should not feel at all constrained in its path forward, but I =
do
not believe that it should establish technical considerations for =
Internet
protocols support of human rights without being clear about the impact
those considerations have on human rights, i.e. it is only a subset of
human rights that the IETF has considered, and is this scoping the
result of some determination of precedence of human rights on the
Internet or simply due to lack of work on the "real complexities =
involved=E2=80=9D,
or other=E2=80=A6

Exactly my point - knowing that I am in the USA, you could very quickly
engage LEA and find out your chances of lawful redress (and they would
explain the various jurisdictional dynamics that apply=E2=80=A6)   =
Absent such
information, you literally have no meaningful process for lawful =
recourse.

What we have done in the draft is map what technical protocol
considerations have an impact on excercising human rights.

That LEAs _might_ have problems conducting investigations is imho not a
problem on the protocol level, nor is it one that has been communicated
by LEAs.

I would disagree here. Because the IETF cannot be tasked to analyze the
capacities and needs of LEAs.

>=20

I think the issue of LEAs can only be solved if they come out with clear
needs, and AFAIK, the general trend is that there is a strong support
for strong encryption (for instance:
http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/01/dutch-government-encryption-go=
od-backdoors-bad/
).

But if there are other protocol considerations I think we should include
them.

The jurisdiction problem is an issue that should be dealt with on
another layer and imho we shouldn't try to find a solution in the IRTF
or IETF.

Best,

Niels

This has been a fascinating discussion so far. I think the question here
asked by Stephen is exactly where I would object. I think the technical
_is_ political. It is not a dichotomy.

The way we build the Internet infrastructure has implications on human
rights, whether it is intentional or not. And the human rights protocol
consideration are a way to make this visible and help us navigate that.

There are no definitive answers here, but making the implications
visible will help guide us making decisions (that we could later revise
if we have other insights).

Best,

Niels

The IETF is capable of deciding the technical considerations (for =

I don't think anyone here want to turn the IETF into a human rights
organization, but as the special rapporteur for freedom of expression
has notes, the IETF has an impact on human rights.

It is also stated in RFC3935:

   The Internet isn't value-neutral, and neither is the IETF.

That is because some rights have a relation to Internet protocols,
whereas others may not.

This is an issue for the content layer, not the protocol layer imho.

I completely agree that there will not be black or white answers, but
hopefully this will provide us a framework to discuss.

Totally agree.  I just wanted to explain where I think the bounds of the
discussion are, and where the expertise of the organization is.

But I think it would be helpful if there were discussion about that,
particularly has relates to Article 3.  Now- maybe it's simply my lack
of understanding of the scope of Article 3, but as I mentioned below, I
would imagine there is some conflict.  See below for more.

Is it really that clear cut?  Is the MIB that handles lawful intercept
at the content layer or the protocol layer, for instance?  Which layer
is encryption at?  Is the IP address not a useful datum for law
enforcement (or other) authorities or criminals (for that matter)?

We reviewed it and could not come up with technical considerations. If
you can provide some (perhaps following the used methodology could
help), I'd be more than happy to include it.

Where it comes to the technical layer, not outside. This work should not
broaden the scope of the IETF imho.

I think the document is pretty clear on how we selected relevant rights,
but we could of course have overlooked something. Happy to discuss.

Absolutely.  In fact, I would say that the choices (specifically =

Indeed.  It would be good to be very explicit about those values.

Are you suggesting that the human rights not included in the document
are not affected by the IETF=E2=80=99s technical considerations?   it is =

clear that is not the case - effective remedy can be directly impacted
by confidentiality; this is likely an inevitable tradeoff, which =

prioritizes one human right over another, in keeping with the historic
stance of the Internet protocols.   There is nothing wrong with such a
tradeoff, but it should explicitly called out (unless you do not believe
that =E2=80=9Ceffective remedy=E2=80=9D is a human right.)

Hi John,

Could you work out a case for this, because I am not so clear how this
would work. IETF or protocols cannot deliver effective remedy.

This is also exactly the reason why we dropped issue of the 'right to be
presumed innocent' from the document. This is effectively a right that
needs to enabled and respected by courts, not by the IETF or protocols.

The same holds true for effective remedy imho.

Best,

Niels

The mapping is not as clear as it might be - have you considered using
the "Charter of Human Rights and Principles for the Internet=E2=80=9D =
from the IGF
=
<http://internetrightsandprinciples.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IR=

as possible basis for structuring the mapping, as it already has done =
the
application of human rights to Internet, and thus it only requires doing =
the
protocol considerations to support those principles (a single mapping =
step),
rather than doing a two-step mapping (human rights->human rights on the
Internet, then human rights on the Internet -> protocol considerations =
to
support human rights on the Internet) all at the same time.

I believe that there serious technical considerations if you want to =
support
effective remedy/due process for violations of personal security that =
occur
on the Internet, and would recommend that the group either deem those
human rights to be unachievable in light of the technical considerations
of the other human rights, or left for future consideration (depending =
on
the groups preference.)

I think we should have a clear differentiation here between the role of
the state (which is to protect and uphold human rights), and that of
non-state actors (which is to respect human rights).

It seems now we're going down the rabbit hole of how we should / could
assist LEAs and courts in upholding their human rights obligations. I
think we do not need to help them with that, they're perfectly able (and
obliged) to do so themselves.

Best,

Niels

I am very familiar with the IRP. The problem with the IRP is that it has
never been ratified or accepted by any intergovernmental body and one
could debate it's interpretation, and it doesn't provide a very
elaborate legal or scientific analysis or justification. Next to that
they are no solely looking at protocols, which also makes the issue
quite hard, because then you need to seperate again. That's why we went
back to the original treaties themselves.

Could you draw some considerations or cases in the light of the protect

non-state actors.

In this case, the question is whether the IETF technical considerations
_hinder_ delivery of the right, not whether they support delivery of the
right.  The point is simply that confidentiality (and anonymity) are =
highly
likely to hinder the delivery of effective remedy for violations of =
personal
security on the Internet, and once that is accepted as a design =
constraint,
then this tradeoff is fine (and should simply be documented)

It=E2=80=99s not whether there are technical considerations necessary to =
support
effective remedy - it=E2=80=99s that there explicitly are not technical =
considerations
to support it because there are other human rights that take precedence
and whose technical considerations result in "effective remedy" being =
put
out of scope of the document.  The document can not be said to be any
comprehensive treatment if it doesn=E2=80=99t clearly address such an =
issue.

I think you mean there is another outcome of the balancing of the
rights, as is for instance done in the Necessary and Proportionate
Principles [0], the Human Rights Council Resolution on the Right to
Privacy in the Digital Age [1] or the report by the UN special
rapporteur on Encryption and Anonymity [2].

In short: this is not a decision the IETF needs to redo. This has
already been discussed (and decided) in other fora. Replicating that
discussion here might make matters more complicated than needed,

Best,

Niels

Sorry, private actors (and that includes the IETF and businesses that use
its protocols) also have the responsibility under the guiding principles of
that framework to conduct due diligence to "identify, prevent, mitigate
and account" for how their activities adversely affect human rights.  This
makes it particularly important that the IETF be clear when it chooses to
do so.

It could potentially be an indirect issue for which the LEAs would need
to seek remedy, not the IETF. Because the stronger obligation is with
the LEA's and the courts.

If you believe that the balancing has already been done in one of those
documents, then simply cite the appropriate document as the basis for
not considering the technical considerations for protocols with respect
to effective remedy/due process.

It=E2=80=99s fine to state that the appropriate tradeoff has already =
been made
elsewhere, but complete omission of the the human right of due process
from the considerations without an explanation why makes it appear as
if the IETF is choosing the appropriate balance.  There=E2=80=99s no =
doubt that
widespread use of encryption and anonymity will make determination of
jurisdiction rather challenging and preempt effective due process (short

if there are technical solutions), but that=E2=80=99s not the IETF issue =
if others
have already performed that human rights balancing.

Hang on. There's no widespread use of real anonymity, (as I'd define
it) and even speaking as if that's possible is very likely to mislead
here. So what do you mean? FB real names? Tor? I don't know.

And that's also (I think) misleading. The issues with jurisdiction
almost all apply even if all is in cleartext. If you claim otherwise
please justify that.

There are a number of real tensions/tussles but we need to ensure
we don't analyse things that aren't real if we're to reach good
conclusions.

Yes, the issues with jurisdiction always apply.  However, the ability=20
to determine jurisdiction for due remedy is made significantly more=20
challenging if Internet protocols provide no visibility into content=20
due to encryption (as they should) and do not provide for reliable
attribution of other communicating parties (as exists if Internet=20
protocols consider the need for support for anonymous services

I'm not at all sure I accept that that happens to any significant
extent where the reason for the problem assigning a jurisdiction
is solely down to encryption. Can you supply some specific real
examples though, maybe I'm missing something?

I note that you didn't answer my direct question as to what you
mean when you use the term anonymity, which you've done again just
there. Can you answer that? (I'd hate for us to waste time and cycles
on using that term to mean radically different things. And to save
you asking, I think use of something like Tor is required but not
sufficient to even approach anonymity.)

Solely?   Perhaps not solely, but that=E2=80=99s not what I said=E2=80=A6 =
I said =E2=80=9Cmade
significantly more challenging if Internet protocols provide no =
visibility

For example, a website selling =E2=80=98knock off=E2=80=9D =
pharmaceuticals results in someone
dying due to bad product.  It is safe to assume that law enforcement =
will pursue
the payment and shipment processes, but if they want catch the actual =
culprit
who has setup and administering the sales website at a hosting center, =
it is made
far more difficult than simply obtaining a order against the hosting =
center so they
may monitor all traffic to/from the server in question.  Even having =
obtained a lawful
order to access such traffic, the use of encryption (ssl for the admin, =
https for the
buyers) and ready use of VPNs makes it hard to determine who/where is =
the criminal
and who might also be at risk.  Directly accessing the server may get =
you enough
info to identify other customers who may also be at risk, but you=E2=80=99=
ve then warned
the culprit that you=E2=80=99re on to them.

The point is that it is fairly easy to provide scenarios where =
encryption can
impede law enforcement in determine the parties and their jurisdiction,
and that might be =E2=80=9Cjust the way the Internet works=E2=80=9D (and =
should work), but
why that is a fair tradeoff should be included in comprehensive document
on considerations for Internet protocols and their impact on human =
rights.

Please=E2=80=A6  VPN=E2=80=99s are the tool of choice for providing =
anonymity on the
Internet today; chain through two or three of them in different =
countries
and the legal hurdles required to unwind them results in process timeout
nearly every time.   Mind you, not everyone is up to doing the legwork
involved in a multiple VPN chain, just as there are common criminals
who do not make use of Tor-based solutions.

The draft in question states:

5.3.2.1.9.  Anonymity

   Question(s): Did you have a look at the Privacy Considerations for
   Internet Protocols [RFC6973], especially section 6.1.1 ?

   Explanation: Anonymity refers to the condition of an identity being
   unknown or concealed [RFC4949].  It is an important feature for many
   end-users, as it allows them different degrees of privacy online.

   Example: Often standards expose private information, it is important
   to consider ways to mitigate the obvious privacy impacts.  For
   instance, a feature which uses deep packet inspection or geolocation
   data could refuse to open this data to third parties, that might be
   able to connect the data to a physical person.

   Impacts: - Right to non-discrimination - Right to political
   participation - Right to freedom of assembly and association - Right
   to security
and is silent about the potential _impact_ on ability to provide due =
process
resulting from the use of anonymous protocols.  Again, it may be the =
case
that this tradeoff is already deemed appropriate via other globally =
accepted
norms and standards (we=E2=80=99ll leave Niels to find the appropriate =
references)
but a comprehensive review of technical issues to be considered by =
protocol
developers and their human rights impact should include clear guidance =
in
any case.

Thanks,
/John

Ok, so do we agree there are no such cases that we can point at?

In the above example, absent use of multiple VPNs/Tor or similar the
IP addresses are very likely sufficient to identify the jurisdictions
involved. So things like TLS and SSH aren't relevant to this discussion
at all.

Correct. Except the reality aiui is that very few people are using
multiple VPNs or Tor. Many people use one VPN (presumably for reasons
associated with copyright protection) but I've not heard any credible
report that many people use multiple VPNs. And if say the user base
of Tor is a couple of million people then we are clearly not in a place
where ciphertext contributing to difficulties in assigning jurisdiction
is a hugely pressing problem.

So for now I don't accept that your particular concern is a significant
one. If someone produces some data my opinion might of course change,
but based on the argument so far you can colour me very unconvinced
that this is a pressing issue.

No Stephen, there are many cases where identification of jurisdiction =
(and
thus provision of due process)  are made significantly more challenging =
for
LEA due to encryption - what I said is that it is not clear whether that =
is solely
a factor.

1) Multiple VPN usage does occur - see below
2) IP addresses are not at assured to provide information about =
jurisdiction
    (please review again the European Cybercrime Centre(EC3) =
presentation
     I referenced earlier which discusses this exact problem.)

Mind you, this is just a quick handful public information out thirty =
pages of such - not anything
particularly hidden or underground (which is more likely resource for =
those who would commit
crimes via such setups...)

The IETF can do whatever it wants - including claiming that it wants =
protocol developers
to comprehensively consider human rights (but in truth just deigning to =
include the select
human rights it considers worthy.)  I believe it would be an =
intellectually stronger position to
make a conscious effort to specify which particular human rights =
particularly pose technical
issues germane to Internet protocol developers, and cite relevant global =
norms and standards
of public policy regarding why those particular human rights are =
included.

Which of those links has numbers of users?

My point is that you've not convinced me of the part that
confidentiality is supposedly playing here.

That there are (non IETF) combinations of IETF technologies
that can be used to make life hard for some LEA is not news.
Just as it is not news that attackers of all kinds will eventually
attack plaintext protocols as recently seen in OEM PC update
programs. I think we've rehearsed all the aspects of the
trade offs in that discussion sufficiently already tbh.

And anyway all of that is just in the noise when it comes to
the issues that exist with jurisdiction - trying to figure out
who has jurisdiction over a single transaction that covers many
countries in various totally legitimate ways (via DNS, cloudy
things, corporate VPN gateways, with content that is legal in
only some places etc.) is much more where it'd be interesting
to discuss jurisdiction. I figure that if governments came up
with something sensible for such normal cases, it'd then be a
lot easier to try figure out how to deal with the silk roads
of the world. Starting from the latter though and from worries
about encryption is just not a good way to approach the problem.

Cheers,
S.

They _can=E2=80=99t_=E2=80=A6  they literally do not understand how the =
Internet and its

Heya, I can't claim that I speak for the RG (or anyone but myself!)
but I think at this point you'll have to show us how protocols could
support those rights. That is, we've discussed this thoroughly and I
think the point you make here (and that Eliot made in another thread
with no responses, sorry Eliot!) is that by narrowing initial
consideration to a subset of rights there are certain risks to this
approach. When this RG was chartered I believe one of the concerns was
a "boil the ocean" concern that required us to focus on some of the
more tractable human rights principles that clearly map on to protocol
considerations. I don't think any of us thinks that once we're done
with free expression and free assembly that we're done.

If there is work the RG should be doing to address your concerns and
you can show us even a sketch of what that would be, I think this
would be a more productive conversation.

best, Joe

I do understand that there are significant challenges for folks
working for governments working with how the technical community
does it's business. That's maybe at it's hardest when governments
try to interact with the IETF, since we don't even have a concept
of membership.

My contention is that it'd be a mistake to try tackle explaining
how the Internet and jurisdictions interact with that use-case in
mind. Much better to try to figure out how to handle more normal
disputes I reckon.

Taking into account the choices of numerous societies as to how all
rights are balanced would indeed be a daunting task.  Fortunately that
is not my request.  While it is true that the charter of this group
focuses on two specific rights, it would nevertheless be inadvisable to
simply ignore their interplay with the others.  To do otherwise will
lead to a lopsided result that does not reflect the complexities of
reality, and would be better described as advocacy rather than research. =


draft-tenoever-hprc-research-02 does indeed recognize the quandary in
the literature review (Section 4).  Section 5 itself recognizes the
right to security.  But that, it seems, is where it ends.  Section 5.3.2
in particular could do with exploring that tension, which would in turn
lead us perhaps to some additional insights in some cases.  For
instance, had we had it to do again, if someone brought a lawful
intercept MIB proposal to the IETF, would the answer once again be RFC
2804 or would it be a standard with strong implementation advice?

An editorial aside: I would suggest  that the authors unbury Section
5.3.2 and make it a separate section, since it is a major change of
topic, an a specific intended output.  It may even be worth its own
document.

Eliot

Isn't this concretely discussed in the last paragraph of 5.3.1 as well?

My personal preference would be to keep this all together for now, since
if we want to operationalize this, it should move outside of the IRTF
anyhow. Section 5.3.2 is a logical conclusion of the research that is
documented in the other parts of the draft and I think it would benefit
from becoming an RFC together.

I think this discussion is getting a bit repetetive. The RG has went
beyond FoE and FoA in the draft, and right to security has been
addressed (5.2.2, 5.3.2). I've also argued here why we did not address
'effective remedy' (because it's an obligation of the state, not of IETF
or protocols, so it cannot directly be impacted by IETF or protocols),
and Stephen and Joe have asked for a concrete case or example that we
thusfar did not get.

So I think we're getting close to an 'agree to disagree'.

Best,

Niels

I=E2=80=99m sorry to be pedantic, but the ability of the state to have =

See above.   There=E2=80=99s nothing states can do in this regard unless =
the basic
protocol framework were to be changed within the IETF, thus leaving them
either without ability to provide meaningful recourse or having to go =
outside
this community and use their lawmaking/regulator ability.   Given the =
near
ubiquitous nature of Internet protocols and inability to work within the =
IETF
to get their requirements considered, they would be without fault in =
doing so.

> So I think we're getting close to an 'agree to disagree'.

Disavowing any responsibility to consider human rights implications of =
IETF
Internet protocols simply because the obligation for some human rights =
lies
with the states is a very dangerous course of action - effectively, you =
discount
the states needs as valid requirements and thus all but compels them to =
use
multi-lateral methods to address those needs.

Yes, I do believe I=E2=80=99ll need to agree to disagree on this one, as =
it takes the IETF
down a path contrary to the multistakeholder approach to problem =
solving.

Best wishes,

>=20

Could you be a bit more specific about the electronic email abuse and
which specific human rights are violated through this and how remedy
could not be sought? A reference to the specific protocol and case would
also be great so that, if we agree, we can make this a case in the
document.

That is a wrong representation of what I said. I only said we should not
guess what the requirements of states are to fulfill their human rights
obligations.

I think this is exactly the multistakeholder way: recognizing there are
different roles and responsibilities for different stakeholders.

And of course (representatives of) states can join the standards
process, and several have done so in the past. The last four IETF
meetings I did presentations for the ISOC policy fellows, which are
mostly governments representatives, and they did not make the point you
are making, actually quite the opposite.

Best,

Niels

Hi,

I think this has been, and continues to be, an interesting discussion
and will try  to capture it in a revision of draft-doria-hrpc-report.

As Joe said we did start with  a specific constraint in the work, but I
have heard the call to look at it in the larger HR context several times
in the group.  While I agree that the research draft should remain
focused on FoE and FoA, I think including text indicating that
restricted perspective, is an appropriate addition to the draft.

On the other hand i think these are important issues to work on and to
explore as to whether they are susceptible to reasonable analysis,
similar to what that we are doing on the first more  limited set.

avri

Niels -

    I=E2=80=99m sorry - you have stated that human rights that are =
obligations of the
    states cannot be directly impact by IETF or its protocols, and are =
now
    proceeding to define a comprehensive guide for assessing human

protocols=E2=80=9D,
    I=E2=80=99ve recused myself from your RG work effort so as to not =

    progress.

    (It is really not productive to elaborate on protocol impacts to the =

Thanks,

I never said that human rights are solely obligations by states. States
have a role to protect human rights, non-state actors should respect
human rights. Those are different roles that come with different
responsibilities.

I never felt like you hindered the process, having disussions and asking
critical and difficult questions is part of research.

As said several times (by me and others), if you give us a concrete case
to chew on I would be more than happy to work it out and see where we
might end up. We did the same with other protocols and issues (for
instance DDoS and the right to assembly and association).

Best,

Very well... Effective remedy (when someone=E2=80=99s human right of =
security
has been violated) is predicated upon providing due process for redress
against the party who committed the harm.   As you note, governments
have an obligation to provide this basic human right to their citizens.
Governments have (to varying degrees) reasonable processes for doing
such when it involves real-world actors (natural persons & businesses
which exist in specific physical locations.)   Governments also have
processes for mutual cooperation when the actors in another country.

When a party on the Internet suffers harm (e.g. someone clicks on a
ransomware email), governments are challenged providing any effective
remedy to the harmed party because this requires information that is
not presently carried in Internet protocols, i.e. the actual real-world
identity of sender.   I can think of dozen reasons why such information
should not be carried in Internet protocols, but it is clear that its =
absence
hinders governments in providing effective remedy for those harmed
over the Internet.

Short of carrying identity information, is there something that could
be done in protocols to aid governments with their responsibility to
provide effective remedy to those harmed over the Internet?  Almost
certainly, but if this group wants to consider such in its research, so
so that its assessment guide can be comprehensive, it would need
engage with the law enforcement community to obtain their views
on such matters.  There are existing cases where LEA has pointed
out the protocol implications for effective remedy, but that generally
happens only well after the fact, and via engagement with the operator
community (e.g. IETF RFC 6302/BCP 162) rather than during protocol
design, as protocol developers generally do not give consideration to
possible harm that could result from their protocols and how effective
remedy is provided.

John,

I'm fine if folks here are interested in analysing this topic as
there are some interesting things to consider, but two things...

Huh? Email has loads of identifiers, and it's fairly easy to
determine the country of origin, which was what you were asking
for yesterday. Doing something effective about that is not always
easy of course, depending on the countries involved. (Or are you
now changing your "ask" to the point where you want to consider
all packets having some "RealName" construct or something? If
so, I don't think wandering into the realms of fiction is that
good a plan, sorry.)

In any case, mail isn't a great example of what you were asking
for yesterday, so better examples would help a lot. Say where a
web site is hacked or some weakness in web site or protocol
design results in the potential for drive-by downloads of
ransomware?

Even better would be if someone had documented a real analysis of
the technical details of such cases - someone must surely have written
that down in a way that's useful here. I reckon that this RG could
otherwise waste a lot of effort on misdirected speculation as to how
things could or do work. So: have you done the legwork to check if
such a description exists that could be useful? If not, would you?

Secondly...

> it would need

You keep saying that. It is not unreasonable to want to get that
input. It is not IMO in the RG's power to ensure that happens. So
if you think it's needed, what are *you* doing to get LEA folks
engaged on this mailing list or to engage with the RG? Expecting
others to do that and calling their efforts into question if they
don't do what you say is needed, seems to me to not be a recipe for
success. (And as an aside - constantly repeating that also doesn't
help.)

Cheers,
S.

Stephen -

   As I noted before, I did not intend to further delay the efforts of =
this
   RG in developing its guide to assessment of potential human rights
   impacts during Internet protocol development.  Avoiding any delay
   remains my goal, and hence I made a very concrete suggesting for

   There=E2=80=99s nothing wrong with scoping the work accordingly, but =
if the
   RG wishes to state that its work will guide protocol authors in =E2=80=9C=
a
   comprehensive analysis that can serve as the basis for discussion
   on whether the protocol adequately protects against human rights
   threats=E2=80=9D (rather then the subset to which it feels presently =

   to make a more general human rights assessment guide possible.

Sure, I saw that. My question was: what are *you* going to do to
make that happen? If you don't have a suggestion you think might
work then I'm quite confused as to how you can call for someone
else to do that. FWIW, I have thought a bit about that but don't
have things to suggest that I think would be that effective. But
given that you are as exercised about this as seems to be the
case perhaps you presumably have better ideas to share.

Cheers,
S.

PS: I note you did not answer my other question as to whether you
had gone looking for good technical descriptions of the kind of
problematic attacks relevant here. That kind of background would
really help to ensure there's no more delay than is warranted by
the importance of the question.

Folks in LEA would be most appropriate, but recognize that they have
requirements based on their needs, not a technical understanding of
the protocols.   This means that any engagement would need to be a
lot more cooperative than may be possible given the current stance
of the research group.  I=E2=80=99ve always thought that research =
involved
seeking out relevant sources of information, but "I am but an egg=E2=80=9D=

when it comes to such matters.

As noted above, it will require research and collaborative engagement;
I am quite willing to try to enlist folks from the LEA community (e.g. =
the
presenter of the RIPE 72 presentation I noted on LEA attribution issues:
Gregory Mounier of the European Cybercrime Centre (EC3), as well as
others as I can find), but such efforts are likely inappropriate until =
the
RG finalizes the scope of the assessment guide it intends to produce.

Yes. Ideally if you could find some LEA folks who are willing to
re-consider their requirements in the open then we could I think
make progress. My take on a lot of this is that LEAs feel stuck
with 19th century requirements which no longer make as much sense
in the face of the 21st century Internet, but are worried that if
they openly discuss those they may end up with less than they had
in the past. But if there's a way to find folks who'd have that

That last is not, IMO, helpful. You're essentially accusing folks
almost of bad faith, despite them engaging with you seriously to
try tease out whether there's an issue here that's tractable to
approach. Did you really mean that? If so, where is the "stance" of
the RG documented and did the RG chairs declare consensus or
something? If so, I missed all of that and only see you making what
seems to me to be a dodgy assertion not backed by my reading of
the list traffic.

I think you know that the IETF and IRTF are places where stuff
happens when people do stuff and not when people tell others
to do stuff. So by all means be an egg, but consider that eggs
are usually undemanding.

Yes. I would expect a proponent repeatedly saying "you must do X"
to have done the research into "X." It'd be different if someone
said once "hey, X could be interesting, anyone know about that?"
but that's not the case here.

That last I'd say might be better answered by the chairs. But this is
a mailing list that anyone can join any time so I don't get why anyone
pointing someone at this list could be inappropriate.

Cheers,
S.

PS: Just to avoid one possible dead-end - suggestions that the RG send
a formal liaison to some other body aren't worth pursuing. Lars has
been rightly consistent in saying that the IRTF doesn't do liaisons
since it doesn't do standards. So I'd say focusing on the informal is
a likely better approach.

Hi all,

To create a next RG version of the draft-tenoever-hrpc-research ID, it's
probably good to draft a clear way forward.

We have had some really good comments and reviews during and before the
call for adoption, thanks for that, but if we want to bring this further
we will need some more reviews.

Two people (Shane and Giovanni) are currently testing the guidelines for
human rights considerations on two actual drafts, which we hope can be
presented in Berlin.

Avri mentioned she had elaborate feedback on the current draft and
Collin Anderson mentioned he would do a review of the draft, which would
both be greatly appeciated.

So now we're looking for a third and potentially fourth reviewer who
could review the draft in within the coming two weeks so we can create a
new version ahead of IETF96 in Berlin.

What we're looking for is a review of the whole document with more or
less coherent notes, suggestions and/or criticisms with which we could
improve the document.

Looking forward to hear from you!

Best,

Niels

Hi,

Happy to review. I'm new to this group, but an old-time at W3C (started Web=
Crypto and Web Authentication APIs) with an interest in human rights and pr=
otocols. I'm also now co-ordinating an EC project (nextleap.eu) that is inv=
estigating how new protocols can help human rights, so hopefully we'll be a=
ble to spare more cycles.

  yours,

That's great Harry, thanks! James Gannon also offered to do a review. So
now I am looking for one more reviewer for:

https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-tenoever-hrpc-research-02

https://github.com/nllz/IRTF-HRPC/blob/master/draft-report.md

Any takers?

Hi,

I was having this conversation in private with Niels and Corinne, and he
asked me to maybe have this discussion on the list. So I'm forward it
here, and will answer his response in a following email.

Best,

Dear Niels,

Thanks for reaching out.

I just went through your draft and, wow, congratulations on it, also on
its comprehensiveness and clarity.

Some feedback:

Section 1:

  * I guess it would be nice to have a phrase alerting about the values
that are implicitly embedded into a protocol.

In other words, engineers have their own set of values which they, often
without much thought, bring to their protocols, as it if was just a
given. This may have unintended/unforeseen consequences -- namely human
rights violations.

I've seen this first hand: I had to do a exercise like that for my
dissertation, by going through my school's ethics commission. In the
end, the ethicist (Aimee) and I wrote a case study paper on value
sensitivity design (VSD) and Internet security, and its consequences[1].
I was introducing bias, prejudice, unfairness with my approach, while
proving other values at the same time.

So what I mean is: engineers may unintentionally violate HR and values
while being oblivious to that, and this may be worth mentioning. I do no
know, however, how often this happens on IETF.

Relevance to the draft:

 - My draft can be found at [2], and when I tried to apply the questions
from 5.3 on it, and some of them didn't seem to apply to it.

And that's where I have another question: are those guidelines targeted
to protocols that assume a real human using it? E.g.: e-mail, chat, etc.
I.e.: protocols that are use to transmit data by anyway related to human
communications.

I am asking because our protocol is a control protocol, designed as a
SOS mechanism to be used by one server under attack (DDoS) to signal to
another servers that the attack is happening.

Therefore, it does not carry any metadata/data related to human
communication. If it is not human communication related, does it imply
that it does not violate human rights? I am not so positive on that
either...

For example: BGP is also machine to machine but if *used* poorly, can
and has been used in censorship cases (see Pakistan Youtube case[3]).

Could you please share your thoughts on this  so I can carry on here
with the analysis?

Thanks a lot,

/giovane

Sorry Niels, I only had a chance to look at this now.

Please find my response inline.

> Not all questions are applicable to all protocols, but do you think none
> of the questions were relevant for you?

I went through all of questions now and here is my feedback.

First, I found it to be a good exercise that, most of all, helped me to
think it through our protocol design, helping me to re-evaluate it,
working as a eye opener to some properties.

As I experienced on a previous protocols and ethics implications
exercise[1], engineers unintentionally put their "values" (in
value-sensitive design terminology) in our protocols as if they were
just a given. Your draft help me to question those.

Since our draft is about intra-networking signaling[2], some questions
were not directly relevant. I enumerate them here. While I think all the
questions are important and have a different role, they may not apply to
all drafts in a same way. So I classified them with regards our own
draft only:

   * Relevant: 5.3.2.1.(1,2,3,4,6,7,8) , 14 (it's not dependable since
it is fall-back opportunistic),16,17,19,

   * More less relevant: 12 (there was a heated discussion on the
language issue in Buenos Aires, and if I am not mistaken, one of the
conclusions was that (i) is very hard to have it in protocol design and
(ii) maybe we should start at the application layer first, since it  is
the layer that directly interact with the users) , 15 (we employ fields
and data specified by another draft by other authors)

   * Not relevant: 5 (since its machine to machine signaling), 9 10
11,13, 18, (since it does not handle end-user data),20 (same reasons),

>>> 	- Changes you will make to your draft
>>> 	- Perhaps even a considerations paragraph that could be added to your
>>> draft.

I'll have to talk to my co-authors first (I am the last author on the
draft), but one easy change is to discuss the security considerations in
the light of human rights implications.


Other comments: on 5.3.2.1.9, first sentence " .. especially section
6.1.1 ?" . The link to 6.1.1. points to the same draft, but it should be
to RFC6973 I believe.

Hi James,

Firstly, thank you so much for taking the time to review the draft. This
note of thanks of course extends tothe others who have volunteered to
review our draft. I am slowly working through your comments and updating
the draft accordingly, and will make sure to come back to each one of you
with additional questions (and elaborate thank you notes!).

@James, I had two questions about your comments:

I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on why you thought the
section on
5.2.3.3. Address Translation and Mobility is a stretch so I can adjust
accordingly?

5.3.2.1.6. Censorship resistance- you mention that it is important to be
clearer on the brackets and the asks. Would it help to provide more
background on what is meant by censorship and how this could occur through
protocols? Or would you suggest that is not what is lacking in the current
description?
Looking forward to hearing from you!

best,

Hi Niels,

I=E2=80=99ve attached a document with comments on the pre-adoption draft.

I am still hoping that someone can address the concerns I raised on the
list about the methodology. I refer specifically to the method by which an
architectural feature has been (or can be) claimed to 'shape the enabling
environment' for a right.

Raised here https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/hrpc/current/msg00401.htm=
l
here https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/hrpc/current/msg00408.html
and here https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/hrpc/current/msg00417.html

Though I agree with some of your conclusions, I do not think the
justification for the claims you have made withstands scrutiny. As a result
it=E2=80=99s presently difficult to see how an engineer could justify givin=
g
additional attention to the features highlighted in the draft.

To re-state what I said previously:

I think the method you have described (quoted below)* is great for
identifying **candidate features*. But my concern is that it=E2=80=99s insu=
fficient
to determine that a candidate feature is an enabling (or restricting)
feature.

> *" It is on the basis of these various case studies, elaborate discussion
> on the mailinglist and at various IETF conferences that we came to
> determine whether an architectural feature is a 'crucial ingredient for
> enabling the ability to exercise specific rights=E2=80=99. "*

If no explicit test is applied to the candidate features
after identification, I think this causes three problems:

(1) *Judgements* *are arbitrary    *

i.e there is no basis on which to argue that the threshold for inclusion
was the same for one technical concept as for another.

(2) *Judgements are not replicable. *

i.e it is not possible to claim that different authors would not have come
to significantly different conclusions than you have.

(3) *Judgements cannot be contested  *

e.g if someone were to disagree with your contention that
internationalisation has a bearing on the right to political participation,
on what basis would we adjudicate who is correct?

Scott

>Hi all,<br>
<br>
To create a next RG version of the draft-tenoever-hrpc-research ID, it&#39;=
s<br>
probably good to draft a clear way forward.<br>
<br>
We have had some really good comments and reviews during and before the<br>
call for adoption, thanks for that, but if we want to bring this further<br=
>
we will need some more reviews.<br>
<br>
Two people (Shane and Giovanni) are currently testing the guidelines for<br=
>
human rights considerations on two actual drafts, which we hope can be<br>
presented in Berlin.<br>
<br>
Avri mentioned she had elaborate feedback on the current draft and<br>
Collin Anderson mentioned he would do a review of the draft, which would<br=
>
both be greatly appeciated.<br>
<br>
So now we&#39;re looking for a third and potentially fourth reviewer who<br=
>
could review the draft in within the coming two weeks so we can create a<br=
>
new version ahead of IETF96 in Berlin.<br>
<br>
What we&#39;re looking for is a review of the whole document with more or<b=
r>
less coherent notes, suggestions and/or criticisms with which we could<br>
improve the document.<br>
<br>
Looking forward to hear from you!<br>
<br>
Best,<br>
<br>
Niels<br>

Dear all,

Thanks for the updates.

@James: see here for all the commits made in the past five hours on the
basis of your review: https://github.com/nllz/IRTF-HRPC/commits/master

@Harry: great, thank you, looking forward to it.

@Scott: Do not worry, have not forgotten about your email but am doing some
more research to see how similar methods were designed for privacy and
security.

Best,

<br>
To create a next RG version of the draft-tenoever-hrpc-research ID, it&#39;=

What we&#39;re looking for is a review of the whole document with more or<b=

Looking forward to hear from you!<br>

Here's my review, with comments attached inline using the "@@" notation bef=
ore my comment. Overall, good work!  Also attached is the "Defend the Web" =
PDF piece by Berners-Lee that brought up some of these concerns in 2012, an=
d notices that Internet architecture might lead to demands for new kinds of=
 rights above and beyond the UN Declaration. While I believe that is out of=
 scope for HRPC, it's an important view point. =20

Sadly, I won't make the f2f meeting as (rather absurdly) the IETF meeting i=
n Berlin is booked the same week as the Privacy-Enchancing Technologies Sym=
posium in Darmstadt Germany, although I will be telling people from PETS ab=
out the importance of increased IETF involvement and mention this group the=
re.=20

   cheers,
      harry

In that spirit, I would like to suggest a one-word edit for purposes of =
clarity=20
of scope.

I would suggest adding the word =E2=80=9Cspecific=E2=80=9D to the =
following sentence -=20

	"However, by carefully considering the answers to the following =
questions, document authors should be able to produce a comprehensive =
analysis that can serve as the basis for discussion on whether the =
protocol adequately protects against human rights threats.=E2=80=9D

as follows -

	"However, by carefully considering the answers to the following =
questions, document authors should be able to produce a comprehensive =
analysis that can serve as the basis for discussion on whether the =
protocol adequately protects against specific human rights threats.=E2=80=9D=


The reason for this edit is related to the methodology used to produce =
the
document - while it is excellent at teasing out mapping between human=20
rights and technical terms, it was focused on extracting concepts from=20=

"an extensive list of protocols and standards that potentially enable =
the=20
Internet as a tool for freedom of expression and association=E2=80=9D   =
As a result,
it unclear how much consideration the other human rights that do not=20
appear at all in the resulting definitions/vocabulary (such as effective=20=

remedy) received in this process.=20

Rather than belabor the point further, the suggested one-word edit would
appropriately set the readers expectations for the otherwise excellent =
draft.

Thanks,
/John

Dear Harry and others,

Thank you kindly for your review and comments!

I went through them over the past hours, and you can find an overview of
the commits based on your comments here @harry:
https://github.com/nllz/IRTF-HRPC/commits/master. I will continue to merge
in the upcoming days.

@John: thank you for your suggestion, @scott: I will continue to research
the other RFCs for such tests & their necessity. In the meantime I updated
the draft with John's suggestion as you can see in commit #132

Best,

Corinne

&gt; &gt;&gt; Objet: [hrpc] way forward draft-tenoever-hrpc-research - revi=
ewers needed<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Hi all,<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; To create a next RG version of the draft-tenoever-hrpc-resear=
ch ID, it&#39;s<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; probably good to draft a clear way forward.<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; We have had some really good comments and reviews during and =
before the<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; call for adoption, thanks for that, but if we want to bring t=
his further<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; we will need some more reviews.<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Two people (Shane and Giovanni) are currently testing the gui=
delines for<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; human rights considerations on two actual drafts, which we ho=
pe can be<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; presented in Berlin.<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Avri mentioned she had elaborate feedback on the current draf=
t and<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Collin Anderson mentioned he would do a review of the draft, =
which would<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; both be greatly appeciated.<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; So now we&#39;re looking for a third and potentially fourth r=
eviewer who<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; could review the draft in within the coming two weeks so we c=
an create a<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; new version ahead of IETF96 in Berlin.<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; What we&#39;re looking for is a review of the whole document =
with more or<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; less coherent notes, suggestions and/or criticisms with which=
 we could<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; improve the document.<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Looking forward to hear from you!<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Best,<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
