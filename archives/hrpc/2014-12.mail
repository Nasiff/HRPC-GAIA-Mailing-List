Thanks a lot, it gave me more time to chew on this, and it's also=0A=

=0A=
True, but since we're doing this at the IETF and to keep the topic=0A=
manageable, I think we'll limit ourselves to protocols and standards,=0A=
but the relation to deployment and implementation can be made.=0A=

In an earlier version there were other headings and order, we'll=0A=
correct this in the next version.=0A=

Very true, we'll change this in the next version. Thanks!=0A=

=0A=
HTTP is the application protocol that forms the foundation web, and is=0A=
therefore a crucial protocol for showing websites, which have become=0A=
crucial for freedom of expression.=0A=
=0A=
Gopher and FTP are indeed other important protocols, that enable many=0A=
crucial services. We chose http here because it relates more to the=0A=
experience of the end-user, and relates very clearly to a service=0A=
(websites) that is a crucial enabler for freedom of expression and=0A=
access to information.=0A=

I think the work of Tim Bray and the http://www.451unavailable.org/=0A=
campaign is extremely valuable. Thank you for reminding me of that=0A=
here. I think we should bring it up again in the HTTP WG.=0A=
=0A=
I would definitely try to include this quite explicit reference to=0A=
human rights in the research (even though it's not a standard yet),=0A=
but I think we should also look for 'deeper layers', and implicit=0A=
mentions of or impacts on human rights enabling protocols=0A=
=0A=
In that way I am also trying to see how we can approach:=0A=
- - emails (and also mailinglists)=0A=
- - VoIP (SIP)=0A=
- - chat (XMPP, IRC)=0A=

I think what we're trying to do is map how protocols and standards=0A=
that have (or had) an impact an human rights, not look at how more=0A=
work can be done to strengthen human rights online (that's another=0A=
part of my job ;) )=0A=
=0A=
I will dive deeper into the work of WG PRECIS and use that to expand=0A=
the example research on the IDNs (as well as=0A=
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5992 which was suggested in the session).=0A=

This is an excellent idea. Would you bring the IPv4 - IPv6 transition=0A=
under the right to access to information, or directly under the right=0A=
of freedom of expression? This might be an real interesting thing to=0A=
dive in, are there specific RFCs you suggest I should have a look at?=0A=
Else I'll dive in it deeply and keep people posted here about my finding.=

Thanks again for these very helpful comments Stephane, looking forward=0A=
to continue the discussion.=0A=
