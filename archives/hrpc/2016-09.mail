A proposal to add at the end of 5.2.2.1 (stored in
<https://github.com/bortzmeyer/IRTF-HRPC/commit/f20144d9a795d617dd6a327fa75779cff8363c41>):

It is important to note that the assessment here is not a general
judgment on these protocols. When they were conceived, there were many
criteria to take into account. For instance, relying on an external
server can be bad for freedom of speech (it creates one more control
point, where censorship could be applied) but it may be a necessity if
the endpoints are not connected and reachable permanently. So, when we
say "protocol X has feature Y, which may endanger the freedom of
speech", it does not mean that protocol X is bad and even less that
its authors were evil. The goal here is to show, with actual examples,
that the design of protocols have practical consequences for some
human rights and these consequences have to be considered at design
time.

In version -05, section 5.2.4, I read:

> The DNS is centralized, and this brings up political and social
> concerns over control.

This is not a correct assessment. If the DNS were really centralized,
each time I want to add/modify something in bortzmeyer.org, I would
have to ask to the Center. (This was true of the previous system,
HOSTS.TXT, described in RFC 608.)

I suggest instead:

> The DNS is organized as a rooted tree, and this brings up political
> and social concerns over control.

I suggest (see
<https://github.com/bortzmeyer/IRTF-HRPC/commit/14d9c0240c05a281d3a5e69fa9787a314a1e516a>):

Speaking of alternative techniques, this is not a complete comparison
of DNS with Namecoin: the later has its own problems and
limitations. The idea here is to show that there are several possible
choices, and they have consequences for human rights.

The current text says (section 5.2.4.2) that DPI is used to modify
DNS answers in Turkey. There is no evidence of that (specially in the
mentioned article), quite the contrary: during recent censorship
events in Turkey, switching to an alternative resolver worked, proving
there was no DPI (another trick used was route hijacking, see
presentation at RIPE
<https://ripe68.ripe.net/presentations/158-bortzmeyer-google-dns-turkey.pdf>)

I suggest to rewrite as
<https://github.com/bortzmeyer/IRTF-HRPC/commit/1edbf4e803841dd63340bcc8b6cf0d46d9bf3428>:

> all DNS protocol messages are inspected by the network, and

Hi,

The last call has not happened yet. 

I just finished a review last week but am still in discussion with the
authors about how to proceed.

My review was most all editorial and can be found at:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4C745NEsGNqR0FFaS12SUhYZEE/view?usp=3Dsha=
ring

One thing, I was assuming that silence on the current version meant
there were no open issues, though I do plan to confirm that before
starting the last call.  If you still have comments, please do send them.

I am also considering asking for a 4 week last call so we can try to
include a wider review group, including HR experts and researchers who
might not be part of this research group.

thanks

avri

Done in

but I cannot submit a PR (there is another one pending before).

[Same problem in -05]

The definition is not too bad (the final rant against IETF is quite
wrong, the IETF, for good or for bad, is certainly not responsible of
all of what is the Internet). May be keep only:

But I have another, milder, suggestion
(<https://github.com/bortzmeyer/IRTF-HRPC/commit/97697dc2ebbc3bdfd61b85b9ea3d576a760632f3>),
which, I believe, does not change the current consensus on DDoS
attacks:

Some people may say that DDoS attacks are the only mean to be heard,
in the current Internet. It is true that Internet has no "public
space", a place where everyone can go and protest and raise issues in
front of everyone. The Internet, and specially the Web, is a more a
series of commercial malls, hold by private entities and where free
speech is limited. This is a complicated issue for human rights, and
specially freedom of speech, but it does not mean that DDoS are a
solution to this real problem.

I suggest to change a part of section 5.2.11 ("DDoS attacks") as in
<https://github.com/bortzmeyer/IRTF-HRPC/commit/c4e0997572a9d480cb2d8058bfb45c26052b133f>. I
fail to see the relationship between DDoS (the subject of the section)
and encryption / passive surveillance. I suggest to delete everything
related to HTTPS.

I do not understand this sentence in section 5.2.9:

> The major use case is thus clearly on the Web server itself, not the
> network.

It seems to me the opposite: 451 is probably used by proxies. If the
origin Web site wants to comply with censorship, they just have to
remove content. (Sections 3 and 4 of RFC 7725 are clear about that.)

Ins ection 5.3.2.1.5, there is an advice to protocol developers,
phrased as a question:

>   Question(s): Does your protocol have text strings that are readable
>   or entered by humans?  Does your protocol allow Unicode encoded in
>   UTF-8 only, thereby shifting conversion issues away from individual
>   choices?  Did you have a look at [RFC6365]?

It took me some time to be sure that "allowing Unicode in UTF-8 only"
was regarded as the best practice ("shifting away from individual
choices" seemed a fascist decision at first). Why not rewriting it:

Does your protocol have text strings that are readable or entered by
humans?  Does your protocol allow Unicode encoded in UTF-8 only,
thereby preventing any conversion issues?  If other character sets /
encodings are allowed, does your protocol mandates a proper tagging of
the charset? Did you have a look at [RFC6365]?

Section 5.3.2.1.7 says:

> Are you aware of any patents that would prevent your standard from
> being fully implemented?

First, this is already covered in length in other IETF documents (RFC
3979, RFC 6701, etc) note wells and things like that. And it is well
implemented by the tools we use, such as the datatracker. IMHO, we
could simply drop this sentence: the average RFC author is already
well aware there are issus with patents.

If we insist on keeping it, I would disagree with it because it seems
to imply we should not standardize patented technologies. If so, we
would standardize nothing: almost every sensible algorithm is
patented. Most (all?) software patents are futile and groundless (not
to mention the fact they are valid only in some countries). If we take
them at face value, we would tie our hands.

Hi Stephane,

First of all, thanks a lot for your extensive review! It was really
helpful. I agreed with all point, except for this one, so let's discuss:

True, but also other issues that are documented have been discussed in
the draft. Patents can have an impact on human rights, so why not
mentioned them?

The question does not say one should not implement because of patents
but asks whether the patent 'would prevent your standard from being
fully implemented'. So it asks whether the limits the use (which is not
necessarily the case).

I've added a reference to RFC3979 and EFC6701, hope that helps.

Happy to discuss and thanks again for your review!

Best,

Niels

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Human Rights Protocol Considerations of the IETF.

        Title           : Research into Human Rights Protocol Considerations
        Authors         : Niels ten Oever
                          Corinne Cath
	Filename        : draft-irtf-hrpc-research-00.txt

Abstract:
   The evergrowing interconnectedness of Internet and society increases
   the impact of the Internet on the lives of individuals.  Because of
   this, the design and development of the architecture of the Internet
   also has a growing impact on society.  This has led to an broad
   recognition that human rights [UDHR] [ICCPR] [ICESCR] have a role in
   the development and management of the Internet [HRC2012] [UNGA2013]
   [NETmundial].  It has also been argued that the Internet should be
   strengthened as a human rights enabling environment [Brown].

   This document provides a proposal for a vocabulary to discuss the
   relation between human rights and Internet protocols, an overview of
   the discussion in technical and academic literature and communities,
   a proposal for the mapping of the relation between human rights and
   technical concepts, and a proposal for guidelines for human rights
   considerations, similar to the work done on the guidelines for
   privacy considerations [RFC6973].

   This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is
   published for informational purposes.

   This document is a product of the Internet Research Task Force
   (IRTF).  The IRTF publishes the results of Internet-related research
   and development activities.  This documents aims to be a consensus
   document of the Human Rights Protocol Consideration Research Group of
   the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF).

I think the question goes sort of to the heart of who we think the
audience is.  If the goal is for individuals to consider these
considerations (which is I think formally what the document says) then
I don't (speaking personally) have a concern about this question.

If the practical goal, however, is actually to influence the way the
IETF or WGs or something make decisions about these matters, then I
think Stephane's point is that IPR generally is an issue the IETF has
wrestled with, and it has come out on the side of not taking a
position on these matters.  The question above militates against
taking that non-position, and that might be reason to worry a little
about this discussion.

Best regards,

A

This is exactly what it aims to do.

Would you have a language suggestion which would help people interpret
this question? I thought the references to RFC3979 RFC6701 would help
reiterate the former reading.

Best,

I don't know if it was in the Markdown source, or because the workflow
has bugs, but some sentences are mangled.

Another issue with the current wording is that it seems to say that it
is up to the RFC / protocol author to check / inquire on possible
patents, a huge task. (And it is very different from IETF policy,
which requires no such effort.)

>=20

The text reads:

   Are you aware of any patents that would prevent your standard
   from being fully implemented [RFC3979] [RFC6701]?

Is does not say: you MUST check all potential patents on the technology
used to implement your protocol.

So I don't share your concerns and I do not think a necessary check /
inquiry is invoked by this guideline question.

Best,

Niels

Hi Niels and everyone,

Following the previous discussion I would propose a few changes:



>    Explanation: The Internet was able to developed into the global
>    network of networks because of the existence of open, non-proprietar=
y
>    standards [Zittrain].  They are crucial for enabling
>    interoperability.  Yet, open standards are not explicitly defined
>    within the IETF. =20


This would be considered news to most people at the IETF.  That doesn't
mean the IETF does ALL open standards but all IETF standards are as
close to open as any I know.  Indeed it's not clear that the focus here
should be the IETF, but rather more general.  There are two approaches
you could take to address this issue:

1.  Drop the sentence.  I think that generalizes the point.

2.  Replace the sentence with something more factually grounded, such as
the following:

"Organizations that espouse open standards philosophies may find
themselves entangled through normative references to closed standards or
proprietary approaches."

And then go on from there.

Again here you may wish to use the IETF as an examplar, but not make
this about the IETF.  By the way, OpenStand is probably worth considering=
=2E

Finally, I think it's useful to explain some of the complexity around
open standards.  This is not an easy subject.  There was an excellent
article by Steven Levy on the impact of normative references in
code.[1]  Some of us remember Carl Malamud, who used to participate in
the IETF.  This is a great read, and his cause is good.  But the IETF is
in a bit of a privileged spot: ISOC and ICANN foot our bills and those
of the W3C, at least in part.  That helps keep things open.  Other
standards organizations still have to pay the bills.  Some do that by
selling documents, others do it through membership fees as a price of
influence.  Traveling around the world to participate is also
expensive.  And so there are many aspects that limit openness.  At the
same time, openness tends to slow things down.  In a hot market, that's
death to a young company.

I would finally point out that open standards on the web is almost an
oxymoron.  Much of the communication to and from the browser is in
javascript, and apps on your phone are written generally to be
two-sided, such that there is NO standardization.  Should there be?=20
What is the value to society and what human rights are at stake?  This
causes me to think a bit about the hourglass model and how we
standardize at its neck more so than elsewhere.

And this brings me back to an earlier point: if this draft is intended
to inform the discussion, let's insure we have captured these sorts of
complexities.  And then if there are clear recommendations to be made,
let's hear them.

While I like a good turn of phrase as much as the next person,  I
suggest that "permissionless innovation" is something of a marketing
term, and it goes undefined within the document.  If you are going to
use it, you should explain what it is and why it is important.

This might be a language issue. What is meant is that there is no IETF
definition for what an 'open standard' is.

Not sure if the ecnomic models of open standards are within the scope of
this document.

I think starting of with documenting the issues is already a great step,
actually.

We could add this definition to the glossary:

"Permissionless innovation," is the freedom to explore new technologies
or businesses without seeking prior approval.

from: Thierer, A. Permissionless Innovation: The Continuing Case for
Comprehensive Technological Freedom. Mercatus Center at George Mason
University, 2014.

Hi Niels (and sorry for so many "finally"s that were not in fact final ;-=
)

Summary:

I've the same problem as Andrew.  Is your target audience the IETF or
the broader community?  An answer to that question will help us in many
ways.

Well so this is the issue.  Is this draft intended to address just the
IETF or be more broadly applicable?  If you want it to be more broadly
applicable the trick here is to use the IETF or other SDOs as examples.=20
Remember, we're here in the iRtf and we don't need to focus on the
IETF.  Choose wisely ;-)

I'm sympathetic to the idea of not wildly expanding the scope of this
document or research group to go beyond human rights.  But I think this
hangs on the notion of whether permissionless innovation is a human
right, and then whether open standards are required for permissionless
innovation.  Carl's work, and the quote from Justice Breyer, get to the
heart of the risks of normative references by laws themselves.  In this
sense, the IETF is just about ideal for a reference, not that most of us
would encourage any such references (what happens if we update an RFC,
for example).  And so again: it depends on your intended purpose.  If it
is to inform society about the relationship between standards and human
rights, the I would say there is a relationship.  If your intent is to
improve IETF processes through an informational document within the
context of the IRTF, then I would say it is possible to scope down.  But
that does limit the applicability of your work.  Again, choose wisely.

See above.  If you are strictly focused on the IETF, I guess you're
right, but I would claim that then this is a missed opportunity.

Ok.  How much depends on the answer to the question at the top of this

That is as good as any, but then I would say there should be some
discussion as to its relationship to human rights.  And that in itself
will also inform you as to how much of the open standards discussion
should be captured.

This gap is not quite an accident, though, and I think that may be
part of the reason you're hearing some anxiety about the target
audience for this document.  

And given that this is an RG inside the IRTF, I don't understand why
an IETF consensus about what an open standard is would matter anyway.

Hi,

Thanks to Niels and Corrine for this update.

While I want to start the RGLC as soon as possible, I want to make sure
that anyone who is actively reviewing this draft before the RGLC, has a
chance to finish their review before the documents changes under them. 
Already got one request to hold until comments were sent in.  I have
asked the authors to hold off with a correct update until ongoing
reviews are in, or so delayed as to be worth including in the RGLC on
the -01.

Curious if anyone else in the 'in active review' situation.  If so,
please let me and/or the list know.    Hopefully any of these reviews
can come in within days to a week so we can take the next step.

Thanks

avri

Hiya,

I spent a bit of time reviewing this finally.

Overall, I think this is a fine piece of work and I look
forward to it becoming an RFC. I don't think it's nearly ready
yet though, there's a lot to fix. (But see #1 below for a
suggested short-cut.)

Cheers,
S.

General, and, I think, important to handle...

(1) What kind of consensus are we aiming for here?

I'm not sure if this would be better off aiming to be a
document that has RG consensus or not. There's a lot of fine
text here, but there's also quite a few instances of text for
which I think it may be quite hard to establish RG consensus,
and where that may take some time and draft iterations.
(You'll see some examples in my specific conments.) Clearly,
processing the document aiming for RG consensus is an option,
and maybe the default option, but I wondered if it'd also be an
option to proceed more quickly with this documenting the
author's research and opinions/conclusions (and not necessarily
RG consensus) and to then later try to extract an updated
version of the guidlines/questionnaire into a separate RFC
aiming for RG consensus. I'm not arguing strongly for that
latter plan but just wanted to ask in case it helps the RG (and
Avri who I guess will have the fun of figuring this out:-).

(2) Length and structure for protocol developers.

I think this is too long to be very useful for protocol
developers.  I doubt many of them will wade through 40+ pages
to get to the bit that's really aimed at them. (And which
pretty much needs a total re-write.) The plan mentioned in #1
might help there I guess but another idea might be to move
section 5.3.2 to the front and make a lot of the rest of the
text into subsequent explanatory material and/or appendices.

(3) What architecture do you mean?

There are 25 lines that mention the term architecture in the
draft and I'm not at all sure the term is used to mean the same
thing throughout.  I'm also not sure that there is an accepted
thing that is "the one true Internet architecture" that has
IETF consensus but you seem to me to be assuming that there is
such a beast. Is this just a language issue or a deep(er)
problem?  I'm not sure, but eliminating references to the
Internet architecture where possible would I think help.  See
some of the specific comments below, but I'd recommend a pass
over the document to check how this term is used as well.  (To
try head off some lines of debate that might follow from this
comment, I do think there are aspects of Internet architecture
for which we do have IETF consensus, but I don't think the IETF
has consensus on any one way in which to put all those together
into something that'd be rightly termed the (or an) Internet
architecture. I think RFC1958 section 2.1 supports that
position btw.)

(4) What does "=3D" mean here?

In section 2 and later (in 5.2.2) you have diagrams with
bracketed terms on the left, then "=3D" and then another term on
the right. I just don't get what you mean by that "=3D" sign. You
say "combine" and "makes up" but frankly I don't get it, even
though I was in some of the meetings where those pictures were
presented.  E.g. in section 2, I don't get how to combine
authenticity and anonymity in any useful sense, as those are
mostly in conflict. And the 2nd picture in section 2 has
connectivity on the RHS, which you defined as being an "extent"
and none of the things on the LHS seem to reflect that at all.
While those pictures may well have been ok for use in
presentations, I'm less happy that they're useful in an RFC.
So, what does "=3D" mean? Can you actually define that relation?
(Apologies if I'm being all "techie" and anal here, but I
really don't get it, honest;-)

(5) The DDoS discussion is still wrong.

I think the discussion of DDoS in section 5.2.11 (see below for
specifics) is not good enough and that section needs to be
re-written or mostly deleted. (Not all list discussions need to
end up with a section in the document.) It may be the case that
what is needed is some discussion of forms of protest using the
Internet, but that I think would better be the topic for
another document, if soeone has the energy/interest. (That
could be interesting too!) For this document, if it is aimed at
the IETF audience, the current text is not useful as it ends up
as a (controversial) NOOP - "don't enable DoS" is already in
RFC3552 since 2003.

(6) The questionnaire is not good enough.

5.3.2.x.y: Please go through these questions yourself (for some
protocol) and write down answers and see then what you think of
the questions.  I think a number of these questions will not
produce meaningful answers in any real attempt at using them.
I also think that someone who is not an author and who is
developing a new protocol needs to have gone through the
exercise at least once before we should publish this document
as any RFC. It is far too easy to ask unanswerable or
non-useful questions otherwise.

(7) Missing introductory text.

I think there's a missing bit of explanatory text about rights
in general that'd help some more IETF-oriented readers.  As I
understand it, in HR all rights are contingent in the sense
that governments are expected to balance competing rights in
all cases. So e.g. even though we have a right to life,
governments can legislate for capital punishment and still
consider themselves signed up to the UDHR. I think this is
worth noting, as for example, it means that we do not
necessarily want to enshrine all the fine concepts on which the
IETF has consensus as human rights, in particular, claiming
that one had a right to encrypt could as a side-effect allow
some governments to claim that they had a right to limit one's
knowledge of mathematics, if that is claimed to compete with
other rights (e.g. to safety). I'm not sure if this is the
right HRPC document to capture that, but it was a surprise for
me when I first found that out, so it may be worth adding a bit
of text explaining basic rights concepts like that here or
somewhere else.

Specific comments (without reference to importance:-)

Note: I'm not quite sure why, but I read this through and
commented as if it were a PhD thesis, which is a bit more
stringent that e.g. IESG evaluation. Apologies if that seems
like nitpicking, but I think given the possibly political
(ab)uses to which this RFC could be put, and since we might
effectively kill the impact of the RG if we do this first RFC
badly, we might be better off to take that approach. I'm
willing to believe that I'm being too nit-picky though:-)

abstract: These ought not have references and I think is too
long.  I'd suggest keeping the 2nd para (minus the reference)
and move the rest to the intro.

intro, p3: How do you know that "open, secure and reliable" are
necessary conditions here? I think you're likely correct, but
I'm not sure that claim is justified in the document or in the
references.

intro, p3: "The Internet aims to be a global network of
networks that provides unfettered connectivity to all users at
all times and for any content [RFC1958]. " The "aims to be"
there seems odd, and I don't see where 1958 says "at all times"
which seems to me overstated.

intro, p3: "One could even argue that the Internet is not only
an enabler of human rights, but that human rights lie at the
basis of, and are ingrained in, the architecture of the
network." Sure one could argue that but is that claimed as an
RG consensus? And you're assuming that there is one true
Internet architecture there I think, which is problematic.

intro, p3: "By doing so, the IETF enabled the manifestation of
the right to privacy, through the Internet's architecture." I
think this shows a misconception of the IETF's role, at least
as I see it. I don't believe that the IETF controls the
Internet's architecture in the sense implied here. If you'd
said "through it's protocol design processes" at the end
instead, then I think that'd be better. And saying "Enabled"
makes it sound like a done-deal and we can all go home, which
strikes me as pretty optimistic;-)

intro, p3, "Openness of communications of the technical design"
what does that mean? And how does it "foster freedom of
communication"?  I don't get the argument here.

intro, p3, "galvanize" is overstated and the IETF doesn't
"ensure" what happens in the network, but only in the protocols
we define - what implementers and operators do with that is
really up to them and not the IETF. That's an important
distinction that's mixed up in a few places in the document,
including in the next sentence - if the IRTF produces this RFC,
that's great and will help to ensure better realisation of HR
issues, but the existence of the RFC itself will not ensure
anything.

section 2: "unfettered" - while I myself do like that term, I
think following the approach from RFC 4084 which you quote here
would be a good general approach for this entire document.
4084 section 1.2 says that it intentionally avoide pejorative
terms so as to increase the likelihood that operators will pay
attention. I think following that guidance in this document
would be good. Most of the text is actually fine in this
respect, but an editing pass based on a review from some (as
yet uninvolved) protocol developers would be a good thing.  For
example, some of the references to companies and products later
on might raise hackles in a way that'd be counter productive.
Anyway, 4084 does not use the term unfettered at all so better
to not say that here.

section 2, and elsewhere: I think the use of the term anonymity
is wrong in almost all cases in this document. While it is the
case that users (and non-technical folk in general, including
law makers) may talk about anonymity, I think there are few to
zero technical folks who think that anonymity is achievable at
any scale today. Tor may be the closest we get, but it's not at
all clear to me that anonymity is really a requirement or a
goal for almost all protocol designers almost all of the time.
I do think we should consider "being hard to track" and similar
as requirements/goals but that's different and I'm not sure we
even have that good an idea about all the trade-offs that are
involved here. I'd recommend checking every time you use this
tern, and getting rid of most of them.  (Will try to point out
the ones I think are problematic below.) Note that the 4949
definition is probably ok(ish:-) but once there are muliple
protocols involved things become very unclear and in real
networks, there's almost always someone somewhere who can
identify (or re-identify) a person, host or bit of s/w and that
context seems to be missing here when you use the term.

2, Defining connectivity as an "extent" is interesting. I'm not
sure if it's precise enough though, e.g.,  what'd "twice better
connectivity" mean? Not sure what to suggest but I do think
you're right to not define it as binary. Maybe refer to RFC4084
here again for some different types of connectivity?

2, "content-agnosticism" - hmm, that seems a bit broken to me
as a definition, it is ok to treat delay intolerant traffic
differently and we do want that sometimes. "Identically" seems
too strong, but I'm not sure what better definition to use
without getting into an essay about net neutrality and similar
things that I don't know much about;-)

2, "end-to-end" - I much prefer to refer to this as an argument
and not a principle. You'll get different opinions on that
though:-)

2, "Internet censorship" - I think this definition is too broad
and could even be read to discourage data minimisation.  It
seems to be missing the concept that the censor is acting
without the agreement of the endpoints, but agreement/consent
is such a slippy concept on the Internet maybe that'd be a bad
idea. Anyway, this seems to broad to me fwiw.

2, "Internet Standards as an Arena for Conflict"... eh...
What? That's not a term to define, it's an argument for over
beer! I think you need to delete that from this section. If you
want to include the text somewhere then find a better way to do
that I'd say. (But I'd still then ask: where is the principle
of constant change defined for all time? :-)

2, "i18n" - I think you're wrong that "Many protocols..." don't
support i18n. It's for sure true that a bunch don't do this
well and ought, but "many" seems overstated. Did you count
them? (Note that for many binary protocols i18n isn't very
relevant at all, if one assume that i18n is mostly important
for end-users and less so for developers or bigger operators.)

2, "Open Standards Conform" - what? That's not a term to
define. I think you also say this elsewhere so deleting this
would be right. And what's RFC2606 got to do with it?

2, "Openness" - I think this is just wrong and am not sure what
you even want to define. You cannot for example have free
access to hosts in my home network, no matter how openly you
ask:-) If you want to define openness, then I think it'd have
to be about processes and not access to hosts.

2, "permissionless innovation" is not all about new protocols.
It's also about using existing protocols in new ways without
having to ask. Not all such uses are usefully described as new
protocols.

2, "Privacy" - I think adding some references to the HR and
legal literature about privacy could help the more technical
readers here.

2, reliable, resiliance and robustness - I'm surprised there're
no references for the first two and puzzled by the references
for the 3rd. There also seem to be very few reference to these
later, which makes it odd to find them here. I wonder if the
formalism you're using (introduced at the end of section 2) has
caused you to shoe-horn in definitions of these?

2, scalable - it's often a challenge in proocol design to
ensure that a protocol scales down as well as up, in the sense
of working well for smaller networks/deployments.  Might be
worth pointing that out as it's relevant here when one
considers designing new protocols potentially putting too much
emphasis on the requirements of only bigger operators (who are
in the room).

2, stateless - is used exactly once later, and stateful is not
used at all later - do you really need this here? (Just define
it when used, but I think protocol developers will get the
meaning anyway.) You could also say that retaining state has
potential privacy impact, which may not be so obvious. (That
retaining state impacts on other protocol features such as
hard-reboot is fairly well understood I think.)

2, "Strong encryption / cryptography" I don't think this is
needed or useful - why is it here? I think the IETF community
know this already, is it useful for some other readership?  If
so who? (Since I'm not sure it'd be that useful for any
readership.)

2, "transparent" - I don't like this definition which I think
is not actually definining the term in the sense in which you
use it in this document. As you actually use the term, it is
mostly about processes, which is not what RFC2775 is about. In
fact, I think you're actually using the term in it's normal
English usage and don't really need a specific definition.
(Though I didn't check all uses of the term.)

2, " The combination of reliability, confidentiality,
integrity, anonymity, and authenticity is what makes up
security on the Internet." No. That is just wrong. For example,
that list omits DoS resilience, bugs (and protocol flaws) that
cause problems like heartbleed, and I think, much else besides.
I'm not sure how to fix this. (But see my general question wrt
"=3D" as used here.)

section 4: I don't accept that "protocols are politics by other
means" - if I develop a way for two computers to interact in my
(non-existent as it happens:-) basement, that is not politics.
If I publish an academic paper on a faster way to do ECDH
that's not politics.  I know it's a quote, but I don't think
you ought present that quote in that way (reading IMO as if it
were an RG consensus statement) without qualification.  The
relevant qualification I think is tricky to formulate but has
something to do with broad deployment or with deployment at
some technical choke point that offers significant control to
someone.

4: I don't get the "values-by-design" point and how it's
relevant to the IETF. I don't recall discussions about that on
IETF/IRTF lists. Is this perhaps something that's really being
discussed outside the IETF/IRTF context? If so, then the
statement that these are a "new focal point" is not correct.
(If you want to say this should or could be a discussion to
have, that'd be fine but that's a different statement.)

4: "tools of enforcement" - I'm not sure what you mean here. If
you mean law enforcement then saying that would be better, but
the sentence is vague, for me anyway so would be better
rephrased.

4: "This document sets out some preliminary steps and
considerations for engineers to take into account when
developing standards and protocols." I think that's a good and
fair statement of where this document is at. But don't you
elsewhere go further? (CHECK)

section 5: It'd be great if you could add links or references
to the source materials here. For example, who'd you interview?
Are the videos avaiable? What's the list of RFCs you read and
which were considered (most) relevant? Similarly for WG lists
analysed etc. I'm sure you have all that stuff and making that
available for later would be great.

5.2.1.4 and 5.2.1.5: (See general point #4 above about "=3D") I
don't think you actually have achieved this "the creation of a
list of technical concepts that when combined create an
enabling environment for human rights." It's a fine goal, but
I'm not sure it's achievable in reality with the kind of
precision claimed in this section.  I don't think the terms
used in the figure in 5.2.1.5 are at all precise TBH, e.g.  the
phrase "good enough" only occurs in this figure and nowehere
else.

5.2.3: "These capabilities for network control and limitations
of the freedom of expression by end hosts can be traced back to
the IPv4 design..." I don't think you have justified this
claim. My argument would be that there is no simlarly
scaled/robust nework against which to compare IP and that does
not have the feature that it allows deployments to limit
freedom of expression. So it may be that this feature/bug is
not IP specific but inherent in large networks. In any case,
the claim seems too much to me. (That might be a useful topic
for the RG to tackle, or maybe someone has already studied this
issue?)

5.2.3.1: On what do you base the claim that source-routing
could be better here? Source-routing seems to usually generate
objections from transport folks. (You'd have to ask them for
the history of that.) Spoofed source IP is a common mechaism
for abuse.  While you do say these are not considered good
practice, you don't say why (or provide a reference) so it
looks to this reader as if you're saying that those "features"
could have been better, but without evidence for that.  (Tor is
lovely, but as currently defined, would not scale to the size
of the Internet as it was quite some years ago.)

5.2.3.2: are you referring to the protocol number here? (As
listed at [1]) That has about 140 protocols many of which
aren't in widespread use.  If so, then I question the claim
that this is really the cause of DPI - I suspect that DPI
devices mostly look deeper into the packet. That also seems to
be indicated when you talk about transports and spdy. I think
this section is confused about the differences between headers
at various layers, and our history of sending cleartext.  That
said, I could see that in future, as we encypt more Internet
traffic, someone may find rights-invading ways to use layer 3
headers but I'm not sure this is a significant issue today. (If
there is evidence of this being done, I'd be interested in
knowing about that. I guess there may be IPv6 options that are
in use like that or have been suggested but you don't cover
those at all that I can see.)

5.2.3.3: I don't think mobile IP could never have displaced NAT
for IPv4.  We'd still have run out of addresses. So I'm not
sure the point made here (that there was a "viable
alternative") is correct at all.

5.2.4: "which enact ICANN's policy" Do you thnk that the ccTLDs
would agree with that? I don't.

5.2.4: I think the fact that new gTLDs are hugely expensive is
well worth a mention, as a deterrent to various freedoms.

5.2.4: I think you're missing some points here, maybe even an
entire subsection. One of the ways around some of the issues
listed is for clients to choose their resolver, e.g. so as to
pick one that does check DNSSEC or that is not subject to the
same regime as a default resolver. That can be blocked at the
IP level, which is one issue. But even if I do that and use
DPRIVE, then that creates a new threat of centralisation of
lots of queries (e.g. at 8.8.8.8) which introduces yet another
point at which control can be enforced or where traffic can be
analysed. Passive DNS also has good and bad aspects. I'd say
some or all of these points would be good to note. (But I'm not
the right person to suggest good text sorry.)

5.2.5: The lack of a mandate for TLS was not the only reason
why the web started out largely cleartext. There were also
significant performance, UI, tooling and missing infrastructure
issues, as well as the charging per certificate business model.
Those were more important issues IMO, even though they do not
nicely tie into the discussion of h2 and it's lack of a mandate
for use of TLS. While I personally regret that, it was the
result of a real and extended and open debate, which I think
also ought be noted.

5.2.5 and 5.2.5.x: While I'm fine with you calling the
development of TLS MitM devices and similar "malicious," I am
pretty sure plenty of folks might argue that. It'd be better to
skip the pejorative language I think, but it is entirely
correct to have the references to the attacks mounted using
such technologies. I'd also tend to not mention specific
companies and products in the body of the text, except where
that is really necessary to make the point.

5.2.5.1: How do you know it was Snowden's relevations that
caused mail service providers (not ISPs!) to "follow Google's
lead"? That may be correct, but I'm not sure there's the public
evidence that they said that was why. (If there is, great, but
please provide a reference, the one you do provide, [Peterson],
is about gmail and not yahoo.) Also, Google use TLS, not SSL
for gmail.

5.2.5.1: "less democratic" - I think it's an error to say that,
since many countries that are considered role models for
democracy could do the same things, "some countries" and
examples would be better. Same with "oppressive regimes" -
there's no need to include that judgement here.  The reference
here [RSF] wasn't accessible to me (no route to host) from a
hotel network and eduroam. That could be nicely ironic, or a
badly chosen reference. (But you need a reference.) The 2012
Libya report also really needs a reference.

   [RSF]
https://en.rsf.org/syria-syria-using-34-blue-coat-servers-23-05-2013,4466=
4.html

5.2.5.2: wrt great-cannon, you might want to note that the IESG
issued a related statement [2]. That's a bit tangential, but I
think is relevant for this work.

   [2]
https://www.ietf.org/iesg/statement/maximizing-encrypted-access.html

5.2.5.2: "Companies like" is pejorative and the patent
application seems irrelevant. "has been largely documented"
calls for a reference. "Oppressive regimes" is also not needed
here as is "little concern for bad human rights records." The
right thing here I think is to note the documented record
without pejoratives and to then let the reader draw their own
conclusions.

5.2.5.2: I don't think the text about h2 is fair. You're
missing a) that there was a real and open debate on the topic,
b) that some important implementations are exclusively h2/tls
and c) that there is a spec for OS for HTTP being developed.
Those are all as relevant as the fact that the outcome of the
debate was to not mandate use of TLS all the time. (Which I do
think is worth saying in this document, but needs more complete
context.)

5.2.6: I think this section is missing some things. First, the
IETF/XSF relationship is relevant here and needs a mention. (As
both good and bad!) Second, OTR is important, as is the
community's failure to produce a better e2e standard for xmpp.
And lastly, I think the tendency of IM deployments to not
deploy interoperable standarsd is missing, which also has good
and bad aspects (good: they can do telegram etc, bad: no
interop).  I'd suggest asking an XMPP expert to review/suggest
text.  (Happy to help find you one if needed.)

5.2.6: "The protocol also has facets that may stifle speech as
users self-censor for fear of surveillance, or find themselves
unable to express themselves freely." That's not an XMPP
specific point - the same applies to email and the web and to
any other protocol that supports interpersonal messaging or
access to sensitive information. I think you ought up-level
this point to a more generic section that calls out issues with
multiple protocols. (Not sure where exactly, but having it here
only isn't great.)

5.2.7: Is this section about P2P in general (I'd consider P2P a
design pattern) or about PPSPP or about BT? Each of those
choices seems wrong. If the first, then that's not the same as
other 5.2.x sections and doesn't mention other P2P protocols
(e.g. RELOAD maybe). If the second, is the deployment of that
sufficient to justify the text? If the 3rd - that's not an IETF
protocol. So I'm not sure what to make of this.

5.2.7: Is it still true to say that P2P is an "increasingly
becoming a popular architecture"? I thought usage stats were
showing the opposite nowadays? The examples given are odd: as
BTC doesn't do file sharing/interpersonal messaging, skype is
no longer really P2P iiuc, and I don't know if spotify really
is or not. Surely BT is the canonical real example?

5.2.7: "mostly delegated" - I'm not sure this is correct.  I
could argue that RELOAD is a counter example. I could further
argue that the lack of deployment of RELOAD (iiuc) may be
evidence that your implied argument that it'd be better for an
organisation like the IETF to try produce complete specs in
this space might be unwise in that it's less likely to result
in deployment.

5.2.7.3: I think ledbat has some protocol features that would
allow deployments (if they are nice) to reduce the scope for
tracking. That's RFC 6817 but I'd have to reread it to check if
there's something useful there, also not sure about ledbat
deployment.

5.2.7.4: Sybil attacks in this context (e.g. astroturfing) seem
to be relevant to more than p2p protocols. In fact wouldn't
they be more common on web based systems, at least as exploited
by/for governments and commercial entities?

5.2.8: There are many kinds of VPN - I think it'd be better to
rename this section to something like "personal VPNs" or
similar, as you don't get into e.g. corporate VPNs.

5.2.8.1: "local illegitimate wiretapping" - that's another
pejorative term for some, "monitoring" would be just as clear.
(Again, not because what you say is wrong, but because there's
no point in antagonising those who read this.)

5.2.8.1: "are way less analyzed and understood" I think I
recall some papers on these kinds of VPN that found some issues
- be good to reference such work if possible, esp if there's a
survey.

5.2.8.3: " VPN providers should at least be transparent on what
information do they store and for how long is being kept" I
fully agree with this, but what's it telling the IETF
readership? Perhaps that RFCs ought identity potentially
sensitive logged data or for how long that needs to be retained
for technical reasons? That migth not belong here anyway but
could be relevant somewhere in the document.

5.2.9: This could be shorter and may better as a part of
section 5.2.5 - why is this one status code so important?

5.2.10: I'm really not sure this (all) belongs here.  The
middlebox debate is old and won't be resolved here, so I'm
don't think it's worthwhile regurgitating the arguments in such
detail. And I think you already said what you need to say when
discussing NATs. I'd say deleting this section is maybe right.

5.2.10: (If you keep it) "IETF's role to prevent such
censorship" again, the IETF is not the Internet police and does
not "prevent" things like that. If you refer to the SPUD BoF,
you should include references to the minutes etc.

5.2.10: "Middleboxes are becoming a proxy for the debate on the
extent to which commercial interests are a valid reason to
undermine the end- to-end principle." That seems like an
opinion, and one I'd be surprised had consensus. Do you need to
say that?

5.2.11: "Some people may say that DDoS attacks are the only
mean to be heard, in the current Internet." Some people say
that the moon landings were faked. Vague reportage like that is
useless. I'd say this entire section needs to be redone with a
strong statement that there is no valid use-case for DDos, and
that DDoS is not a valid form of protest. I think such a
statement is one that would have RG and indeed IETF consensus.
I'm very sure that no concept of DDoS as a valid form of
protest would garner consensus in either the RG or the IETF.

5.2.11: "seem to suggest that the IETF should try to ensure
that their protocols cannot be used for DDoS attacks" That's
very understated and maybe even misleading. I would say that
the IETF has long-standing consensus that DDoS is an attack
that protocols should mitigate to the extent they can and that
DDoS vectors in protocols are basically bugs.  RFC3552 (section
4.6) from 2003 covers this and says that standards MUST
describe DoS issues.

5.2.11: The linkage between private sector control of networks
and DDoS is IMO entirely unconvincing. NRENs are generally
private sector and have major issues with DDoS. (I'm sitting in
a talk on that topic right now.) It is not at all clear that
anyone who'd claim that they are using a DDoS attack to protest
would actually be protesting about a network operator - it is
much more likely they are protesting about some content owner,
who may be public  or private sector.

5.2.11: I don't think we need or want the argument based on PM
here at all. The argument about motivations for PM in RFC7258
depends on there being some justifiable reasons for monitoring.
(Otherwise we would not need to even point out that motivations
don't matter.) There are no such close-to-good arguments at all
for DDoS, so drawing that analogy is misleading.

5.2.11: If the RG feel there is a need to discuss a possibility
for fully opted-in people to collectively protest, (I do not)
then you should invent a new term for that and clearly say that
even though such protest might appear to the network as beng
the same as a DDoS (and hence be treated as an attack), that is
not the same as a DDoS, where 100% of real cases involve
compromised hosts or hosts being used as reflectors without
permission. If the RG feel there is a need to discuss forms of
protest on the Internet, then I think an entirely different
section is needed, probably with a different structure.

5.3.1: I'm not sure the "HR threats" model is the right thing
here. The same was true of rfc6973 as well, as you say, but in
this case, I'm not sure you really even need the concept. 5.3.2
just says stuff like "did you think about <foo>" so I don't see
a need to say that "<foo> is a threat." I don't think you lose
anything by losing that concept entirely. There is also a
danger in including that risk analysis model here in that doing
so might cause later disussion to be somewhat blinkered.

5.3.1: "This is by no means an attempt to cherry picks rights,
if other rights seem relevant, please contact the authors
and/or the hrpc mailinglist." I'd delete that, it's not that
appropriate for an RFC (it was for an I-D). But if you do want
to say something about a contact point, the RG list would be
better. (The phrasing "cherry pick" is also a bit odd.)

5.3.2: The title here is a bit inaccurate and misleading.
You're presenting guidelines for protocol designers, and not
for "HR considerations."

5.3.2: I don't think that many IETFers follow or read RFC4101.
(RFC4101 is a useful, good thing, but one that's not much used
iiuc.)


5.3.2.1.2: We're updating RFC3552 now, and the update will
include some guidance on privacy considerations. I'm not sure
if it'd be better to reference that draft now or not though, as
it's early days. Probably best to refer to BCP72 though, as
that'll remain the right reference when the 3552bis work is
done.

5.3.2.1.2: "Could your protocol counter traffic analysis, or
data minimization?" oops - I don't think you want to counter
data minimisation. Better to split that into two questions
probably.

5.3.2.1.3: This set of questions need work. All protocols "look
at the packet content" or else do nothing at all. I think you
want to ask people to think about which fields in the packet
they need to access and to try to minimize those, and if
possible, discourage others from looking at the rest (e.g. by
enabling encryption of those).  I also have no clue what " Is
the protocol transparent about its decisions?" means. And the
last question is also pretty meaningless when looked at in
isolation. (I think I already commented on the agnosticism
phrase as used here before. The same issues apply to the
explanatory text here.)

5.3.2.1.5: "readable by humans" is not the right criterion
here. What you need to say is that "have to be understood by
humans." For example, DNS names are mostly readable but IDNs
are not, depending on which form one uses. For some protocols
it is entirely fine still to use ascii for human-readable
labels, if those are only seen by developers or more capable
admins.

5.3.2.1.6: Re-using existing identifiers (e.g. MAC addresses)
is the more common way that (re-)identification is enabled in
protocols. You should point that out. I think the "make ...
transparent" point is worth splitting from the identifier issue
too - identifiers are very common, but making filtering
apparent is much less so, and will be missed if you bundle
these two things together. The last two questions aren't really
useful though and are more explanatory text then real new
questions.

5.3.2.1.7: These are not useful, as phrased for IETFers.  The
only useful part here is the 2nd last question (use other
things that are proprietary), the rest are not as they are
already handled in IETF processes, and we do not want yet more
bureaucracy. The explanatory material is way too long and also
not useful for the IETF audience. The example given is an
interesting thing, but far from a typical protocol, so
therefore is not a good example.

5.3.2.1.8: This entire section is useless for IETFers, except
the last question about extensibility. The explanatory text and
example however don't address that and are also not useful.

5.3.2.1.9: The question was asked already. Anonymity is not a
useful goal in almost all IETF protocols, and if it were, it'd
be a first order requirement (e.g. if we wrote an RFC for Tor)
and would not be missed. Delete this section entirely.

5.3.2.1.10: The emphasis here is wrong. You should be asking
about whether the protocol generates or processes anything that
can be, or be tightly correlated with, PII. Many protocols have
identifiers that are perfectly safe, until the host running the
protocol is something that a person carries with them. The
section needs a rewrite to take that approach.

5.3.2.1.11: Mixing accessibility and statefulness is wrong.
Both are fine questions, but should not be bundled.  The
example is bad - HTML5 is the current spec and is not that RFC.

5.3.2.1.12: I think this is arguably duplicative and the issue
will (or should) be caught via other IETF processes apart from
HR considerations. I'd delete this, though it's mostly harmless
here.

5.3.2.1.13: Again, this bundles things in a counterproductive
manner. Split the topology/architecture points from the
discriminaton/implication ones. (Even if you think those relate
in terms of HR, that does not mean that they ought be bundled
together in a questionnaire.)

5.3.2.1.14: I don't think this belongs in the questionnaire
either. It's covered alredy in other IETF processes, when most
relevant, so is not useful to ask about here.

5.3.2.1.15: This needs to be rewritten, there are 13 questions
in the text which is entirely pointless. I would not bother to
try answer those. You should just ask how confidentiality is
supported and between what endpoints and how keying is done.
(Or something like that, I didn't try the full re-write that is
needed.) The re-write should also bundle this with most of the
next two sections. (See below.)

5.3.2.1.15: The cryptographic parts of this should be merged
into a rewritten 5.3.2.1.14. If there are non-crypto bits of
this then those need better explanatory text as it'd not be
relevant for most protocols. (I mean things like database
consistency.) I'm not sure if anything would remain when this
and the previous section were re-written.)

5.3.2.1.17: As per 5.3.2.1.16.

5.3.2.1.18: This is entirely duplicative and should be deleted.

5.3.2.1.19: I've no clue if this'd be useful to ask. Only
testing would tell. (It might be, but I'm really not sure.)

Nits/editorial...

lots of places: there are too many over-long sentences that
make this hard to read and less clear. I'd really recommend
getting rid of as many of those as you can. The first non-quote
paragraph of the intro is a good example.

intro, "the core of the Internet, its architectural design
is..." Using "core" is a bad term there, mostly we mean
something quite different when we talk about the Internet's
core or similar.  (And that's another assumption that there's
one true architecture.)

intro, "properly defined, described and protected as such" - I
don't think "defined" is needed there, and it might not be
correct either.

intro, "New protocols, particularly those that upgrade the core
infrastructure of the Net, should be designed to continue to
enable fundamental human rights." I'd drop the "core
infrastructure" bit there, it's a distraction and liable to
generate argument about what is or is not core, e.g. BGP is
clearly core but is not otherwise mentioned in this document,
and maybe correctly.

intro, "The authors believe that the issues that have been
raised by the reviewers have been addressed." Sorry to be
raising more:-)

section 2: I think some better formatting is needed here to
distinguish the terms defined from the text, which in some
cases is fairly long. Just add bullets or quoting or something.

2: "In the discussion of human rights and Internet architecture
concepts developed in computer science, networking, law,
policy-making and advocacy are coming together" Sorry, what is
coming together in what discussion(s)? Too many commas there to
be sure I think. (BTW, "architecture concepts" may well be an
ok use of that word:-)

2, "censorship resistance" does not "prevent" censorship, I'd
say mitigate is better than prevent.

2, "confidentiality" - why not refer to 4949 there?

2, "debugging" - the term debug is not used in the draft, why
do you need the definition?

2, "decentralized" - why is "opportunity for" needed in this
definition? I don't get that.

2, "technical this means..." needs fixing.

2, "Heterogenity" typo

2, "autonomous organizations" do you mean ASes? If so, say so.
If not, better to avoid the word autonomous here.

2, "integrity" - why not refer to 4949?

2, "Inter-operable" is normally not hyphenated in the IETF

2, i18n - funny line breaks there make that hard to read

2, l10n - you don't actually use that abbreviation so why
define it?

2, "The combination of the end-to-end principle,
interoperability, resilience, reliability and robustness are
the enableing factors that result in on the Internet.  " That
(non-)sentence needs fixing. I don't even know what you want to
say tbh.

section 3: I think this short section is missing text to the
effect that you think the answer to question 2 is yes.

section 4: you say "five clear positions" but they are not
clearly delineated in the document. I'd suggest using some
headings or some other way to make these more distinct in the
document.

4: "embedded into the Internet's architecture" (top of p13) has
another claim that there's one true Internet architecture.  You
could change this one to be the set of protocols defined by the
IETF or something similar.

4: " As it stems from the issues as they arise in the field of
technical engineering." That's not a sentence.

5: "step taken by the research group" that's ambiguous - I
think you mean the set of authors and their research groups at
home and not the HRPC, which I don't think collectively read
all the RFCs you mean. (I think it's fine to say that the
authors were the one who did the work, if that's what you
mean.)

5.1: This section duplicates the intro to section 5. Is there a
new point being made?

5.2: "(detailed under "2.vocabulary used")" do you mean section
2 there? Saying "Section 2" with the right xml2rfc incantation
will cause the tools rendering to make that a link, which'd be
nice.

5.2.1.1: "was assembly" typo.

5.2.1.5: figures are better numbered and with captions.

5.2.2.1: I guess there's a heading level bug here in the
document sounce?

5.2.3.1: "ability for those hosts to assemble or to
consensually express themselves" huh? When/how do hosts
assemble or do things consensually? Confusing people and hosts
like that is odd.

5.2.3.2: Why refer to spdy and not h2? And is that even a good
reference? The 4906 reference also puzzled me. (Even more:-)

5.2.5: Why "because of it's simple design"? I'd have thought it
was more complicated than that and that a combination of HTTP,
HTML, open-source browsers and web servers and cool content was
involved.

5.2.5: TLS and SSL could do with references.

5.2.5: Gen-ART? Huh? That's wrong. Gen-ART are fine people but
they don't do what you say they do any more than any other set
of IETFers. Are you confusing them with the IAB statement on
encryption perhaps? Otherwise that is quite the puzzle for
me:-)

5.2.5.1: What does "of the first" mean? "From the start"?

5.2.5.1: "have been corrected in TLS1.3" is in the wrong tense
- "are being corrected" is correct.

5.2.5.1: TEMPORA, XKEYSCORE etc need references. Those can get
hard to find later, at least good references can be hard to
find.

5.2.6.1: I assume the URLs [1] and [2] don't need to be there
and are xml2rfc artefacts to be fixed. Also, you should use
example.com and example.net as per the usual way of handling
examples in RFCs.

5.2.7: "often seen" - by whom? I'm not sure that IETFers would
share that opinion, so better to say who you do mean. "remains
critical" is also overstated.

5.2.7.1: "directed directly" typo

5.2.7.2: "throtteling" typo

5.2.7.5: Why does only this section have a conclusions
subsction? I'd say be consistent.

5.2.8.1: you could lose the heading here (consistency again:-)

5.2.8.1: some VPNs (but not the ones you care about) are not
point-to-point.

5.2.8.1: "There are multiple implementations and protocols used
in provisioning a VPN" do you really mean provisioning a VPN
there? That'd mean something else for some IETFers. I think you
mean setting up a personal VPN for a single user but not quite
sure.

5.2.8.5: The URL for [PET2015VPN] didn't work for me. I found
the paper elsewhere though.

5.2.8.7: This bit seems fairly repetitive, other than the
timing/correlation issues. You could maybe say that more
briefly.

5.2.10: The URL for [Walfish] doesn't point at the named paper
- what's up there?

5.2.11 (and elsewhere): "Many individuals, not excluding IETF
engineers, have argued..." I hate constructs like that that
assert that somebody somewhere (unnamed) thinks/says something.
I don't see why any such assertions (of rumour basically) ought
be in the RFC series. There are other examples of this
construct in the draft.

5.2.11: Not all DoS attacks flood with traffic. Some might
consume CPU cycles, in future some will consume limited power,
and could be used in a DDoS. I don't think it's useful here
(for the IETF audience) to define 3 types of DDoS attack.

5.3: "Having established how..." I don't think you established
the "how." It'd be fair to do s/how/that/ though. (Twice.) That
sentence is also overlong. Also "... by detailing how..." is
similarly not correct.

5.3.1: 1st para is repetitive. Delete it.

5.3.1: The term "ICTs" isn't common in the IETF community. I'd
say rephrase stuff to not use that.

5.3.2.x.y: Having such deep levels of TOC makes life harder for
readers and those commenting and later using this. Flatten it
tall out. Or, do you even need the 5.3.2.x.y headings at all?
(Some of the section titles don't map that well to the
content.)

5.3.2.1.1: s/e2e principle/e2e argument/ again:-)

5.3.2.1.1: the communication content would be concealed, not
the act of communication

5.3.2.x.y: It'd be a very good idea to add an appendix that
lists the questionnaire questions only (with those being
numbered). That way, people who want to do this analysis can
just use that part (at least the 2nd time).  If doing that,
please ensure each question also has an unique number/label in
the body of the document too, so that folks can find/correlate
things.

5.3.2.1.4: The last para of explanatory material should not
re-define COMSEC etc. Just point people at RFC3552/BCP72.  (But
as BCP72.) The global adversary is also not purely passive, I'd
lose that phrase.

5.3.2.1.5: "many protocols" is not usefully true I think.

10.2: delete this.

Hi,

Stephen, thanks for this review.  Just wanted to give a quick ack, but
indicate that I am still working my way through it and looking forward
to the authors' responses and any list discussion that may occur on some
of the points that were made in this review.

At this point, are there any other reviews on the -00 we should be
waiting for?

Thanks

avri

Dear Stephen,

Thanks a lot for this extensive review! I hope you (and others) will
allow us some time to give it the attention it deserves, I hope to be
coming back with a full response at the beginning of next week.

>>
>> 5.2.8.1: "local illegitimate wiretapping" - that's another

>> (Again, not because what you say is wrong, but because there's

>> - be good to reference such work if possible, esp if there's a
>> survey.
>>
>> 5.2.8.3: " VPN providers should at least be transparent on what
>> information do they store and for how long is being kept" I
>> fully agree with this, but what's it telling the IETF
>> readership? Perhaps that RFCs ought identity potentially
>> sensitive logged data or for how long that needs to be retained
>> for technical reasons? That migth not belong here anyway but
>> could be relevant somewhere in the document.
>>
>> 5.2.9: This could be shorter and may better as a part of
>> section 5.2.5 - why is this one status code so important?
>>
>> 5.2.10: I'm really not sure this (all) belongs here.  The
>> middlebox debate is old and won't be resolved here, so I'm
>> don't think it's worthwhile regurgitating the arguments in such
>> detail. And I think you already said what you need to say when
>> discussing NATs. I'd say deleting this section is maybe right.
>>
>> 5.2.10: (If you keep it) "IETF's role to prevent such
>> censorship" again, the IETF is not the Internet police and does
>> not "prevent" things like that. If you refer to the SPUD BoF,
>> you should include references to the minutes etc.
>>
>> 5.2.10: "Middleboxes are becoming a proxy for the debate on the
>> extent to which commercial interests are a valid reason to
>> undermine the end- to-end principle." That seems like an
>> opinion, and one I'd be surprised had consensus. Do you need to
>> say that?
>>
>> 5.2.11: "Some people may say that DDoS attacks are the only
>> mean to be heard, in the current Internet." Some people say
>> that the moon landings were faked. Vague reportage like that is
>> useless. I'd say this entire section needs to be redone with a
>> strong statement that there is no valid use-case for DDos, and
>> that DDoS is not a valid form of protest. I think such a
>> statement is one that would have RG and indeed IETF consensus.
>> I'm very sure that no concept of DDoS as a valid form of
>> protest would garner consensus in either the RG or the IETF.
>>
>> 5.2.11: "seem to suggest that the IETF should try to ensure
>> that their protocols cannot be used for DDoS attacks" That's
>> very understated and maybe even misleading. I would say that
>> the IETF has long-standing consensus that DDoS is an attack
>> that protocols should mitigate to the extent they can and that
>> DDoS vectors in protocols are basically bugs.  RFC3552 (section
>> 4.6) from 2003 covers this and says that standards MUST
>> describe DoS issues.
>>
>> 5.2.11: The linkage between private sector control of networks
>> and DDoS is IMO entirely unconvincing. NRENs are generally
>> private sector and have major issues with DDoS. (I'm sitting in
>> a talk on that topic right now.) It is not at all clear that
>> anyone who'd claim that they are using a DDoS attack to protest
>> would actually be protesting about a network operator - it is
>> much more likely they are protesting about some content owner,
>> who may be public  or private sector.
>>
>> 5.2.11: I don't think we need or want the argument based on PM
>> here at all. The argument about motivations for PM in RFC7258
>> depends on there being some justifiable reasons for monitoring.
>> (Otherwise we would not need to even point out that motivations
>> don't matter.) There are no such close-to-good arguments at all
>> for DDoS, so drawing that analogy is misleading.
>>
>> 5.2.11: If the RG feel there is a need to discuss a possibility
>> for fully opted-in people to collectively protest, (I do not)
>> then you should invent a new term for that and clearly say that
>> even though such protest might appear to the network as beng
>> the same as a DDoS (and hence be treated as an attack), that is
>> not the same as a DDoS, where 100% of real cases involve
>> compromised hosts or hosts being used as reflectors without
>> permission. If the RG feel there is a need to discuss forms of
>> protest on the Internet, then I think an entirely different
>> section is needed, probably with a different structure.
>>
>> 5.3.1: I'm not sure the "HR threats" model is the right thing
>> here. The same was true of rfc6973 as well, as you say, but in
>> this case, I'm not sure you really even need the concept. 5.3.2
>> just says stuff like "did you think about <foo>" so I don't see
>> a need to say that "<foo> is a threat." I don't think you lose
>> anything by losing that concept entirely. There is also a
>> danger in including that risk analysis model here in that doing
>> so might cause later disussion to be somewhat blinkered.
>>
>> 5.3.1: "This is by no means an attempt to cherry picks rights,
>> if other rights seem relevant, please contact the authors
>> and/or the hrpc mailinglist." I'd delete that, it's not that
>> appropriate for an RFC (it was for an I-D). But if you do want
>> to say something about a contact point, the RG list would be
>> better. (The phrasing "cherry pick" is also a bit odd.)
>>
>> 5.3.2: The title here is a bit inaccurate and misleading.
>> You're presenting guidelines for protocol designers, and not
>> for "HR considerations."
>>
>> 5.3.2: I don't think that many IETFers follow or read RFC4101.
>> (RFC4101 is a useful, good thing, but one that's not much used
>> iiuc.)
>>
>>
>> 5.3.2.1.2: We're updating RFC3552 now, and the update will
>> include some guidance on privacy considerations. I'm not sure
>> if it'd be better to reference that draft now or not though, as
>> it's early days. Probably best to refer to BCP72 though, as
>> that'll remain the right reference when the 3552bis work is
>> done.
>>
>> 5.3.2.1.2: "Could your protocol counter traffic analysis, or
>> data minimization?" oops - I don't think you want to counter
>> data minimisation. Better to split that into two questions
>> probably.
>>
>> 5.3.2.1.3: This set of questions need work. All protocols "look
>> at the packet content" or else do nothing at all. I think you
>> want to ask people to think about which fields in the packet
>> they need to access and to try to minimize those, and if
>> possible, discourage others from looking at the rest (e.g. by
>> enabling encryption of those).  I also have no clue what " Is
>> the protocol transparent about its decisions?" means. And the
>> last question is also pretty meaningless when looked at in
>> isolation. (I think I already commented on the agnosticism
>> phrase as used here before. The same issues apply to the
>> explanatory text here.)
>>
>> 5.3.2.1.5: "readable by humans" is not the right criterion
>> here. What you need to say is that "have to be understood by
>> humans." For example, DNS names are mostly readable but IDNs
>> are not, depending on which form one uses. For some protocols
>> it is entirely fine still to use ascii for human-readable
>> labels, if those are only seen by developers or more capable
>> admins.
>>
>> 5.3.2.1.6: Re-using existing identifiers (e.g. MAC addresses)
>> is the more common way that (re-)identification is enabled in
>> protocols. You should point that out. I think the "make ...
>> transparent" point is worth splitting from the identifier issue
>> too - identifiers are very common, but making filtering
>> apparent is much less so, and will be missed if you bundle
>> these two things together. The last two questions aren't really
>> useful though and are more explanatory text then real new
>> questions.
>>
>> 5.3.2.1.7: These are not useful, as phrased for IETFers.  The
>> only useful part here is the 2nd last question (use other
>> things that are proprietary), the rest are not as they are
>> already handled in IETF processes, and we do not want yet more
>> bureaucracy. The explanatory material is way too long and also
>> not useful for the IETF audience. The example given is an
>> interesting thing, but far from a typical protocol, so
>> therefore is not a good example.
>>
>> 5.3.2.1.8: This entire section is useless for IETFers, except
>> the last question about extensibility. The explanatory text and
>> example however don't address that and are also not useful.
>>
>> 5.3.2.1.9: The question was asked already. Anonymity is not a
>> useful goal in almost all IETF protocols, and if it were, it'd
>> be a first order requirement (e.g. if we wrote an RFC for Tor)
>> and would not be missed. Delete this section entirely.
>>
>> 5.3.2.1.10: The emphasis here is wrong. You should be asking
>> about whether the protocol generates or processes anything that
>> can be, or be tightly correlated with, PII. Many protocols have
>> identifiers that are perfectly safe, until the host running the
>> protocol is something that a person carries with them. The
>> section needs a rewrite to take that approach.
>>
>> 5.3.2.1.11: Mixing accessibility and statefulness is wrong.
>> Both are fine questions, but should not be bundled.  The
>> example is bad - HTML5 is the current spec and is not that RFC.
>>
>> 5.3.2.1.12: I think this is arguably duplicative and the issue
>> will (or should) be caught via other IETF processes apart from
>> HR considerations. I'd delete this, though it's mostly harmless
>> here.
>>
>> 5.3.2.1.13: Again, this bundles things in a counterproductive
>> manner. Split the topology/architecture points from the
>> discriminaton/implication ones. (Even if you think those relate
>> in terms of HR, that does not mean that they ought be bundled
>> together in a questionnaire.)
>>
>> 5.3.2.1.14: I don't think this belongs in the questionnaire
>> either. It's covered alredy in other IETF processes, when most
>> relevant, so is not useful to ask about here.
>>
>> 5.3.2.1.15: This needs to be rewritten, there are 13 questions
>> in the text which is entirely pointless. I would not bother to
>> try answer those. You should just ask how confidentiality is
>> supported and between what endpoints and how keying is done.
>> (Or something like that, I didn't try the full re-write that is
>> needed.) The re-write should also bundle this with most of the
>> next two sections. (See below.)
>>
>> 5.3.2.1.15: The cryptographic parts of this should be merged
>> into a rewritten 5.3.2.1.14. If there are non-crypto bits of
>> this then those need better explanatory text as it'd not be
>> relevant for most protocols. (I mean things like database
>> consistency.) I'm not sure if anything would remain when this
>> and the previous section were re-written.)
>>
>> 5.3.2.1.17: As per 5.3.2.1.16.
>>
>> 5.3.2.1.18: This is entirely duplicative and should be deleted.
>>
>> 5.3.2.1.19: I've no clue if this'd be useful to ask. Only
>> testing would tell. (It might be, but I'm really not sure.)
>>
>> Nits/editorial...
>>
>> lots of places: there are too many over-long sentences that
>> make this hard to read and less clear. I'd really recommend
>> getting rid of as many of those as you can. The first non-quote
>> paragraph of the intro is a good example.
>>
>> intro, "the core of the Internet, its architectural design
>> is..." Using "core" is a bad term there, mostly we mean
>> something quite different when we talk about the Internet's
>> core or similar.  (And that's another assumption that there's
>> one true architecture.)
>>
>> intro, "properly defined, described and protected as such" - I
>> don't think "defined" is needed there, and it might not be
>> correct either.
>>
>> intro, "New protocols, particularly those that upgrade the core
>> infrastructure of the Net, should be designed to continue to
>> enable fundamental human rights." I'd drop the "core
>> infrastructure" bit there, it's a distraction and liable to
>> generate argument about what is or is not core, e.g. BGP is
>> clearly core but is not otherwise mentioned in this document,
>> and maybe correctly.
>>
>> intro, "The authors believe that the issues that have been
>> raised by the reviewers have been addressed." Sorry to be
>> raising more:-)
>>
>> section 2: I think some better formatting is needed here to
>> distinguish the terms defined from the text, which in some
>> cases is fairly long. Just add bullets or quoting or something.
>>
>> 2: "In the discussion of human rights and Internet architecture
>> concepts developed in computer science, networking, law,
>> policy-making and advocacy are coming together" Sorry, what is
>> coming together in what discussion(s)? Too many commas there to
>> be sure I think. (BTW, "architecture concepts" may well be an
>> ok use of that word:-)
>>
>> 2, "censorship resistance" does not "prevent" censorship, I'd
>> say mitigate is better than prevent.
>>
>> 2, "confidentiality" - why not refer to 4949 there?
>>
>> 2, "debugging" - the term debug is not used in the draft, why
>> do you need the definition?
>>
>> 2, "decentralized" - why is "opportunity for" needed in this
>> definition? I don't get that.
>>
>> 2, "technical this means..." needs fixing.
>>
>> 2, "Heterogenity" typo
>>
>> 2, "autonomous organizations" do you mean ASes? If so, say so.
>> If not, better to avoid the word autonomous here.
>>
>> 2, "integrity" - why not refer to 4949?
>>
>> 2, "Inter-operable" is normally not hyphenated in the IETF
>>
>> 2, i18n - funny line breaks there make that hard to read
>>
>> 2, l10n - you don't actually use that abbreviation so why
>> define it?
>>
>> 2, "The combination of the end-to-end principle,
>> interoperability, resilience, reliability and robustness are
>> the enableing factors that result in on the Internet.  " That
>> (non-)sentence needs fixing. I don't even know what you want to
>> say tbh.
>>
>> section 3: I think this short section is missing text to the
>> effect that you think the answer to question 2 is yes.
>>
>> section 4: you say "five clear positions" but they are not
>> clearly delineated in the document. I'd suggest using some
>> headings or some other way to make these more distinct in the
>> document.
>>
>> 4: "embedded into the Internet's architecture" (top of p13) has
>> another claim that there's one true Internet architecture.  You
>> could change this one to be the set of protocols defined by the
>> IETF or something similar.
>>
>> 4: " As it stems from the issues as they arise in the field of
>> technical engineering." That's not a sentence.
>>
>> 5: "step taken by the research group" that's ambiguous - I
>> think you mean the set of authors and their research groups at
>> home and not the HRPC, which I don't think collectively read
>> all the RFCs you mean. (I think it's fine to say that the
>> authors were the one who did the work, if that's what you
>> mean.)
>>
>> 5.1: This section duplicates the intro to section 5. Is there a
>> new point being made?
>>
>> 5.2: "(detailed under "2.vocabulary used")" do you mean section
>> 2 there? Saying "Section 2" with the right xml2rfc incantation
>> will cause the tools rendering to make that a link, which'd be
>> nice.
>>
>> 5.2.1.1: "was assembly" typo.
>>
>> 5.2.1.5: figures are better numbered and with captions.
>>
>> 5.2.2.1: I guess there's a heading level bug here in the
>> document sounce?
>>
>> 5.2.3.1: "ability for those hosts to assemble or to
>> consensually express themselves" huh? When/how do hosts
>> assemble or do things consensually? Confusing people and hosts
>> like that is odd.
>>
>> 5.2.3.2: Why refer to spdy and not h2? And is that even a good
>> reference? The 4906 reference also puzzled me. (Even more:-)
>>
>> 5.2.5: Why "because of it's simple design"? I'd have thought it
>> was more complicated than that and that a combination of HTTP,
>> HTML, open-source browsers and web servers and cool content was
>> involved.
>>
>> 5.2.5: TLS and SSL could do with references.
>>
>> 5.2.5: Gen-ART? Huh? That's wrong. Gen-ART are fine people but
>> they don't do what you say they do any more than any other set
>> of IETFers. Are you confusing them with the IAB statement on
>> encryption perhaps? Otherwise that is quite the puzzle for
>> me:-)
>>
>> 5.2.5.1: What does "of the first" mean? "From the start"?
>>
>> 5.2.5.1: "have been corrected in TLS1.3" is in the wrong tense
>> - "are being corrected" is correct.
>>
>> 5.2.5.1: TEMPORA, XKEYSCORE etc need references. Those can get
>> hard to find later, at least good references can be hard to
>> find.
>>
>> 5.2.6.1: I assume the URLs [1] and [2] don't need to be there
>> and are xml2rfc artefacts to be fixed. Also, you should use
>> example.com and example.net as per the usual way of handling
>> examples in RFCs.
>>
>> 5.2.7: "often seen" - by whom? I'm not sure that IETFers would
>> share that opinion, so better to say who you do mean. "remains
>> critical" is also overstated.
>>
>> 5.2.7.1: "directed directly" typo
>>
>> 5.2.7.2: "throtteling" typo
>>
>> 5.2.7.5: Why does only this section have a conclusions
>> subsction? I'd say be consistent.
>>
>> 5.2.8.1: you could lose the heading here (consistency again:-)
>>
>> 5.2.8.1: some VPNs (but not the ones you care about) are not
>> point-to-point.
>>
>> 5.2.8.1: "There are multiple implementations and protocols used
>> in provisioning a VPN" do you really mean provisioning a VPN
>> there? That'd mean something else for some IETFers. I think you
>> mean setting up a personal VPN for a single user but not quite
>> sure.
>>
>> 5.2.8.5: The URL for [PET2015VPN] didn't work for me. I found
>> the paper elsewhere though.
>>
>> 5.2.8.7: This bit seems fairly repetitive, other than the
>> timing/correlation issues. You could maybe say that more
>> briefly.
>>
>> 5.2.10: The URL for [Walfish] doesn't point at the named paper
>> - what's up there?
>>
>> 5.2.11 (and elsewhere): "Many individuals, not excluding IETF
>> engineers, have argued..." I hate constructs like that that
>> assert that somebody somewhere (unnamed) thinks/says something.
>> I don't see why any such assertions (of rumour basically) ought
>> be in the RFC series. There are other examples of this
>> construct in the draft.
>>
>> 5.2.11: Not all DoS attacks flood with traffic. Some might
>> consume CPU cycles, in future some will consume limited power,
>> and could be used in a DDoS. I don't think it's useful here
>> (for the IETF audience) to define 3 types of DDoS attack.
>>
>> 5.3: "Having established how..." I don't think you established
>> the "how." It'd be fair to do s/how/that/ though. (Twice.) That
>> sentence is also overlong. Also "... by detailing how..." is
>> similarly not correct.
>>
>> 5.3.1: 1st para is repetitive. Delete it.
>>
>> 5.3.1: The term "ICTs" isn't common in the IETF community. I'd
>> say rephrase stuff to not use that.
>>
>> 5.3.2.x.y: Having such deep levels of TOC makes life harder for
>> readers and those commenting and later using this. Flatten it
>> tall out. Or, do you even need the 5.3.2.x.y headings at all?
>> (Some of the section titles don't map that well to the
>> content.)
>>
>> 5.3.2.1.1: s/e2e principle/e2e argument/ again:-)
>>
>> 5.3.2.1.1: the communication content would be concealed, not
>> the act of communication
>>
>> 5.3.2.x.y: It'd be a very good idea to add an appendix that
>> lists the questionnaire questions only (with those being
>> numbered). That way, people who want to do this analysis can
>> just use that part (at least the 2nd time).  If doing that,
>> please ensure each question also has an unique number/label in
>> the body of the document too, so that folks can find/correlate
>> things.
>>
>> 5.3.2.1.4: The last para of explanatory material should not
>> re-define COMSEC etc. Just point people at RFC3552/BCP72.  (But
>> as BCP72.) The global adversary is also not purely passive, I'd
>> lose that phrase.
>>
>> 5.3.2.1.5: "many protocols" is not usefully true I think.
>>
>> 10.2: delete this.
