Ok let me bring this up again but more abstractly:

What I'm really trying to get at is:

By what mechanism would violations of human rights in a protocol enter
the (technical) conversation?

1. It appeared in some news source and seemed relevant.

2. It appeared somewhere on social media.

3. Someone involved with the IETF raised it at the (technical
discussion) table or perhaps on some IETF mailing list probably
motivated by #1 and/or #2. It's less likely their personal rights were
violated but it's of course possible.

4. Someone previously external to the IETF appealed to the IETF or a
specific technical committee about how some protocol is affecting or
may affect human rights in their sphere.

5. Some external (to the IETF) organization, for example some UN
interest agency or nation-state or interest group or even court, etc,
appealed to the IETF et al.

It's not magic.

Somehow an issue was raised.

And I believe it's reasonably enumerative.

Given that, then by what process might any of those be judged as
credible and important?

Because without some defined channel all one really has is one party
shouting into the wilderness and hoping someone in that wilderness
will be sympathetic and perhaps politically persuasive.

Thanks a lot for this chairs!

Sorry to respond so late. Gisela and I are working on this, and we try to t=

Best,

Niels and Gisela
