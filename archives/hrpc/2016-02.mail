Hi Stephane,

It is a bit belated, sorry for that. We'll launch is at the same time
wih the new website for the RG in the first week of March.

If you want to see the film before the first week of March you can see
it at the M3aawg meeting on the 15th of February.

Thanks for your patience.

Best,

Niels

That&#39;s overly judgemental and tries to predict, as this thread is<br>

What about in the course of cyber-warfare? If one country were<br>
cyber-attacking another one could imagine the target&#39;s first response,<=

source if possible. Or it could be on their list of engagements.<br>
<br>
Or maybe not?<br>
<br>
Maybe that&#39;s a cyber-war crime? Who is to say if no one writes this<br>
all down with definitions etc?<br>
<br>
Something very similar just went on on NANOG recently.<br>
<br>
Someone suggested de-peering ASNs entirely which did not respond to<br>
complaints of DDoS and other misbehavior.<br>
<br>
I asked if there were any contracts, any agreements, anything written<br>
down which they have agreed to or can be generally cited to identify<br>
this behavior?<br>
<br>
Was there any process in place for this de-peering?<br>
<br>
Any way for a misidentified or misunderstood or even just disagreeing<br>

 be<br>

<br>
I suggested that right now it&#39;s &quot;Justice By Router Commands&quot; =
which<br>
seems primitive and error-prone at best, vigilantism basically.<br>
<br>
We can lay out hypothetical scenarios ad infinitum and try to use them<br>

or.<br>
<br>
All one really should be discussing are the boundaries of DDoS and the<br>
implications for human rights issues.<br>
<br>
To adjudicate DDoS per se is misguided just as adjudicating whether<br>
kinetic warfare is right or wrong as a pre-requisite to any discussion<br>
of human rights in that warfare context.<br>
<br>
Some things are bad, some very bad, but human rights issues remain<br>
even within very, very distasteful contexts.<br>
<br>
Even the worst criminals have human rights.<br>

Dear all,

I hope this email finds you well. Corinne and I added a substantial
amount of text to the methodology draft, which we just made available
for you here:

https://www.ietf.org/id/draft-varon-hrpc-methodology-04.txt

Most additions are a first stab at actual human rights considerations,
modeled after RFC6973. I pasted this specific part also underneath for
your convenience and consideration. There are also some small
additions to the middlebox text as well as other nits than can be
found directly in the draft (and in the diff
https://tools.ietf.org/rfcdiff?url2=3Ddraft-varon-hrpc-methodology-04.txt
).

Looking forward to the discussion, as well as questions and comments.

Best,

Niels


### Human Rights Threats
The human rights threats on the Internet come in a myriad of forms.
Protocols and standards can harm or enable the right to freedom of
expression, right to non-discrimination, right to equal protection,
right to be presumed innocence, right to participate in cultural life,
arts and science, right to freedom of assembly and association, and
the right to security. An end-user who is denied access to certain
services, data or websites may be unable to disclose vital information
about the malpractices of a government or other authority.  A person
whose communications are monitored may be prevented from exercising
their right to freedom of association. In a worst-case scenario,
protocols that leak information can lead to physical danger. A
realistic example to consider is when opposition leaders in
totalitarian regimes are subjected to torture on the basis of
information gathered by the regime through information leakage in
protocols.

This sections details several =E2=80=98common=E2=80=99 threats to human r=
ights,
indicating how each of these can lead to human rights violations/harms
and present several examples of how these threats to human rights
materialize on the Internet. This threat modeling is inspired by
{{RFC6973}} Privacy Considerations for Internet Protocols, which bases
itself on security threat analysis. This method is by no means a
perfect solution for assessing human rights risks in Internet
protocols and systems; it is however the best approach currently
available. Certain human rights threats are indirectly considered in
Internet protocols as part of the standard privacy and security
considerations. Others suggested are tailored specifically to human
rights, and represents considerations not currently considered in
other RFCs.

Many threats, enablers and risks are linked to different rights. This
is not unsurprising if one takes into account that human rights are
interrelated, interdependent and universal.
Here however we're not discussing all human rights because not all
human rights are relevant to ICTs in general and protocols and
standards in particular. This is by no means an attempt to cherry
picks right, if other rights seem relevant, please contact the authors
and/or the hrpc mailinglist.

### Human Rights Guidelines

This section provides guidance for document authors in the form of a
questionnaire about a protocol being designed. The questionnaire may
be useful at any point in the design process, particularly after
document authors have developed a high-level protocol model as
described in {{RFC4101}}.

Note that the guidance provided in this section does not recommend
specific practices.  The range of protocols developed in the IETF is
too broad to make recommendations about particular uses of data or how
human rights might be balanced against other design goals.  However,
by carefully considering the answers to each question, document
authors should be able to produce a comprehensive analysis that can
serve as the basis for discussion of whether the protocol adequately
protects against human rights threats.  This guidance is meant to help
the thought process of a human rights analysis; it does not provide
specific directions for how to write a human rights protocol
considerations section (following the example set in {{RFC6973}}).

#### Right to freedom of expression

##### Connectivity
Does your protocol honor the end-to-end principle?

##### Privacy
Did you have a look at the Guidelines in the Privacy Considerations
for Internet Protocols {{RFC6973}} section 7? Does your protocol in
any way impact the confidentiality of protocol metadata? Does your
protocol countering traffic analysis, or data minimisation?

##### Security
Did you have a look at Guidelines for Writing RFC Text on Security
Considerations {{RFC3552}}?

##### Content agnosticism
If your protocol impact packet handling, does it look at the packet
content? Is it making decisions based on the content of the packet? Is
the protocol transparent about its decision? Does your protocol
prioritize certain content or services over others?

##### Internationalization
Does your protocol have text string that are readable or entered by
humans? Does your protocol allow Unicode encoded in UTF-8 only,
thereby shifting conversion issues away from individual choices? Did
you have a look at {{RFC6365}}?

##### Censorship resistance
Does your protocol make censorship easier by exposing specific
identifiers that could be sensitive for filtering. When filtering is
happening, does your protocol help make it apparent or transparent?

##### Open Standards
Is your protocol fully documented in a way that it could be easily
implemented, improved, build upon and/or further developed. Is there
any proprietary code needed for the implementation, running or further
development of your protocol?

##### Heterogeneity Support
Does your protocol support heterogeneity by design? Does your protocol
allow for multiple types of hardware? Does your protocol allow for
multiple types of application protocols?

#### Right to non-discrimination

##### Anonymity
Did you have a look at the Privacy Considerations for Internet
Protocols {{RFC6973}}, especially section 6.1.1 ?

##### Privacy
See above

##### Pseudonymity
Did you have a look at the Privacy Considerations for Internet
Protocols {{RFC6973}}, especially section 6.1.2 ?

##### Content agnosticism
See above

##### Accessibility
Is your protocol optimized for low bandwidth and high latency
connections? Could your protocol also be developed in a stateless manner
?

#### Right to equal protection

##### Content agnosticism
See above

#### Right to be presumed innocent
Is is possible to deploy your protocol without a single point of
control? If applicable, can it also implemented in a federated way?

##### Anonymity
See above

##### Privacy
See above

##### Security
See above

#### Right to political participation

##### Accessibility
when websites, web technologies, or web tools are badly designed, they
can create barriers that exclude people from using the Web. Is your
protocol designed to provide an enabling environment for people with
disabilities? It might be relevant to look at the W3C Web
Accessibility Initiative for examples and guidance.

##### Internationalization
See above

##### Censorship resistance
See above

#### Right to participate in cultural life, arts and science

##### Open Standards
See above

##### Localization
Does your protocol live up to standards of internationalization (see
above)? Have you considered localizing your protocol for relevant
audiences?

##### Internationalization
See above

##### Censorship resistance
See above

#### Right to freedom of assembly and association

##### Connectivity
See above

##### Decentralization
Does your protocol contribute to more centralized points of control?
Can your protocol be implemented without one single point of control.
If applicable, can your protocol be deployed in a federated manner?

##### Censorship resistance
See above

##### Pseudonymity
See above

##### Anonymity
See above

#### Security
See above


#### Right to security

##### Reliability
Is your protocol fault tolerant? Does it degrade gracefully? Do you
have a documented way to announce degradation? Do you have measures in
place for recovery or partial healing from failure? Is your protocol
able to maintain dependability and performance in the face of
unanticipated changes or circumstances?

##### Confidentiality
(cf {{RFC6973}} ) Which information related to identifiers or data  is
exposed to each other protocol entity (i.e., recipients,
intermediaries, and enablers)?  Are there ways for protocol
implementers to choose to limit the information shared with each
entity?  Are there operational controls available to limit the
information shared with each entity?

What controls or consent mechanisms does the protocol define or
require before personal data or identifiers are shared or exposed via
the protocol?  If no such mechanisms or controls are specified, is it
expected that control and consent will be handled outside of the protoco
l?

Does the protocol provide ways for initiators to share different
information with different recipients?  If not, are there mechanisms
that exist outside of the protocol to provide initiators with such
control?

Does the protocol provide ways for initiators to limit which
information is shared with intermediaries?  If not, are there
mechanisms that exist outside of the protocol to provide users with
such control?  Is it expected that users will have relationships that
govern the  use of the information (contractual or otherwise) with
those who operate these intermediaries?

Does the protocol provide ways for initiators to express individuals'
preferences to recipients or intermediaries with regard to the
collection, use, or disclosure of their personal data?

##### Integrity
Does your protocol maintain and assure the accuracy of data? Does your
protocol maintain and assure the consistency of data? Does your
protocol in any way allow for the data to be (intentionally or
unintentionally) altered?

##### Authenticity
Do you have enough measures to confirm the truth of an attribute of a
single piece of data or entity? Can the attributes get garbled along
the way (see security)? If relevant have you implemented IPsec and
other Standard Security Best Practices?

##### Anonymity
See above

#### Right to education

##### Acceptability
Do your protocols adhere to the principle of non-discrimination (see
above)? Do your protocols adhere to the principle of content
agnosticism (see above)?

##### Availability
Do your protocols use or depend on proprietary code? Also see 'Open
Standards' above. Also see 'Connectivity' above.

##### Accessibility
See above

##### Adaptability
Could your protocol stifle or hinder permissionless innovation in any
way? See 'Connectivity' above

I'd argue for a different angle in the "right to be presumed innocent"
section within the "right to equal protection" section.

The text there seems to be focused on decentralization, which helps prevent
centralized control, but is different from presumed innocence.  The failure
case I'd want that section to talk to is the a hypothetical standard for
DPI policy, where you wouldn't want to block all bittorrent traffic for
copyright infringement. Instead, you'd want to have systems and standards
structured so that protocols and carried data isn't discriminated based on
stereotypes, but on the specific content of the transmissions.

Here's a proposal for an alternate framing:
What is the potential for discrimination against users of your protocol?
How can use of your protocol be used to implicate participants?

<br>
Dear all,<br>
<br>
I hope this email finds you well. Corinne and I added a substantial<br>
amount of text to the methodology draft, which we just made available<br>
for you here:<br>
<br>
<a href=3D"https://www.ietf.org/id/draft-varon-hrpc-methodology-04.txt" rel=
=3D"noreferrer" target=3D"_blank">https://www.ietf.org/id/draft-varon-hrpc-=
methodology-04.txt</a><br>
<br>
Most additions are a first stab at actual human rights considerations,<br>
modeled after RFC6973. I pasted this specific part also underneath for<br>
your convenience and consideration. There are also some small<br>
additions to the middlebox text as well as other nits than can be<br>
found directly in the draft (and in the diff<br>
<a href=3D"https://tools.ietf.org/rfcdiff?url2=3Ddraft-varon-hrpc-methodolo=
gy-04.txt" rel=3D"noreferrer" target=3D"_blank">https://tools.ietf.org/rfcd=
iff?url2=3Ddraft-varon-hrpc-methodology-04.txt</a><br>
).<br>
<br>
Looking forward to the discussion, as well as questions and comments.<br>
<br>
Best,<br>
<br>
Niels<br>
<br>
<br>
### Human Rights Threats<br>
The human rights threats on the Internet come in a myriad of forms.<br>
Protocols and standards can harm or enable the right to freedom of<br>
expression, right to non-discrimination, right to equal protection,<br>
right to be presumed innocence, right to participate in cultural life,<br>
arts and science, right to freedom of assembly and association, and<br>
the right to security. An end-user who is denied access to certain<br>
services, data or websites may be unable to disclose vital information<br>
about the malpractices of a government or other authority.=C2=A0 A person<b=
r>
whose communications are monitored may be prevented from exercising<br>
their right to freedom of association. In a worst-case scenario,<br>
protocols that leak information can lead to physical danger. A<br>
realistic example to consider is when opposition leaders in<br>
totalitarian regimes are subjected to torture on the basis of<br>
information gathered by the regime through information leakage in<br>
protocols.<br>
<br>
This sections details several =E2=80=98common=E2=80=99 threats to human rig=
hts,<br>
indicating how each of these can lead to human rights violations/harms<br>
and present several examples of how these threats to human rights<br>
materialize on the Internet. This threat modeling is inspired by<br>
{{RFC6973}} Privacy Considerations for Internet Protocols, which bases<br>
itself on security threat analysis. This method is by no means a<br>
perfect solution for assessing human rights risks in Internet<br>
protocols and systems; it is however the best approach currently<br>
available. Certain human rights threats are indirectly considered in<br>
Internet protocols as part of the standard privacy and security<br>
considerations. Others suggested are tailored specifically to human<br>
rights, and represents considerations not currently considered in<br>
other RFCs.<br>
<br>
Many threats, enablers and risks are linked to different rights. This<br>
is not unsurprising if one takes into account that human rights are<br>
interrelated, interdependent and universal.<br>
Here however we&#39;re not discussing all human rights because not all<br>
human rights are relevant to ICTs in general and protocols and<br>
standards in particular. This is by no means an attempt to cherry<br>
picks right, if other rights seem relevant, please contact the authors<br>
and/or the hrpc mailinglist.<br>
<br>
### Human Rights Guidelines<br>
<br>
This section provides guidance for document authors in the form of a<br>
questionnaire about a protocol being designed. The questionnaire may<br>
be useful at any point in the design process, particularly after<br>
document authors have developed a high-level protocol model as<br>
described in {{RFC4101}}.<br>
<br>
Note that the guidance provided in this section does not recommend<br>
specific practices.=C2=A0 The range of protocols developed in the IETF is<b=
r>
too broad to make recommendations about particular uses of data or how<br>
human rights might be balanced against other design goals.=C2=A0 However,<b=
r>
by carefully considering the answers to each question, document<br>
authors should be able to produce a comprehensive analysis that can<br>
serve as the basis for discussion of whether the protocol adequately<br>
protects against human rights threats.=C2=A0 This guidance is meant to help=
<br>
the thought process of a human rights analysis; it does not provide<br>
specific directions for how to write a human rights protocol<br>
considerations section (following the example set in {{RFC6973}}).<br>
<br>
#### Right to freedom of expression<br>
<br>
##### Connectivity<br>
Does your protocol honor the end-to-end principle?<br>
<br>
##### Privacy<br>
Did you have a look at the Guidelines in the Privacy Considerations<br>
for Internet Protocols {{RFC6973}} section 7? Does your protocol in<br>
any way impact the confidentiality of protocol metadata? Does your<br>
protocol countering traffic analysis, or data minimisation?<br>
<br>
##### Security<br>
Did you have a look at Guidelines for Writing RFC Text on Security<br>
Considerations {{RFC3552}}?<br>
<br>
##### Content agnosticism<br>
If your protocol impact packet handling, does it look at the packet<br>
content? Is it making decisions based on the content of the packet? Is<br>
the protocol transparent about its decision? Does your protocol<br>
prioritize certain content or services over others?<br>
<br>
##### Internationalization<br>
Does your protocol have text string that are readable or entered by<br>
humans? Does your protocol allow Unicode encoded in UTF-8 only,<br>
thereby shifting conversion issues away from individual choices? Did<br>
you have a look at {{RFC6365}}?<br>
<br>
##### Censorship resistance<br>
Does your protocol make censorship easier by exposing specific<br>
identifiers that could be sensitive for filtering. When filtering is<br>
happening, does your protocol help make it apparent or transparent?<br>
<br>
##### Open Standards<br>
Is your protocol fully documented in a way that it could be easily<br>
implemented, improved, build upon and/or further developed. Is there<br>
any proprietary code needed for the implementation, running or further<br>
development of your protocol?<br>
<br>
##### Heterogeneity Support<br>
Does your protocol support heterogeneity by design? Does your protocol<br>
allow for multiple types of hardware? Does your protocol allow for<br>
multiple types of application protocols?<br>
<br>
#### Right to non-discrimination<br>
<br>

<br>
##### Accessibility<br>
Is your protocol optimized for low bandwidth and high latency<br>
connections? Could your protocol also be developed in a stateless manner<br=
>
?<br>
<br>
#### Right to equal protection<br>
<br>
##### Content agnosticism<br>
See above<br>
<br>
#### Right to be presumed innocent<br>
Is is possible to deploy your protocol without a single point of<br>
control? If applicable, can it also implemented in a federated way?<br>

<br>
##### Privacy<br>
See above<br>
<br>
##### Security<br>

#### Right to political participation<br>
<br>
##### Accessibility<br>
when websites, web technologies, or web tools are badly designed, they<br>
can create barriers that exclude people from using the Web. Is your<br>
protocol designed to provide an enabling environment for people with<br>
disabilities? It might be relevant to look at the W3C Web<br>
Accessibility Initiative for examples and guidance.<br>

place for recovery or partial healing from failure? Is your protocol<br>
able to maintain dependability and performance in the face of<br>
unanticipated changes or circumstances?<br>
<br>
##### Confidentiality<br>
(cf {{RFC6973}} ) Which information related to identifiers or data=C2=A0 is=
<br>
exposed to each other protocol entity (i.e., recipients,<br>
intermediaries, and enablers)?=C2=A0 Are there ways for protocol<br>

Hi Will,

Thanks for this. Reply inline:

They are both seperate human rights, so they both have their own
section (4.7.2.3 and 4.7.2.4)

The draft may be unclear here, but decentralization (4.7.2.7.2) is
part of the right to freedom of assembly and association (4.7.2.7),
not of any other right at the moment.

So, would you argue decentralization should be part of Right to
freedom of expression (4.7.2.1) and Right to non-discrimination
(4.7.2.2) as well?

>=20

Would this be fixed by the proposal suggested above, or do you think
we should add other considerations to the Right to non-discrimination
(4.7.2.2) ?

Looking forward to discuss!

Best,

Niels

My point above was trying to say that right to presumed innocence feels
uncentered. the sample questions feel like 'decentralization' and the
subheadings are anonymity, privacy, and security.  None of those places
feel like they solicit answers to the questions below. I think content
agnosticism is the closest area, and should be in there.

&gt;<br>
&gt; I hope this email finds you well. Corinne and I added a<br>
&gt; substantial amount of text to the methodology draft, which we just<br>

&gt; ### Human Rights Threats The human rights threats on the Internet<br>
&gt; come in a myriad of forms. Protocols and standards can harm or<br>
&gt; enable the right to freedom of expression, right to<br>
&gt; non-discrimination, right to equal protection, right to be presumed<br=
>
&gt; innocence, right to participate in cultural life, arts and science,<br=
>
&gt; right to freedom of assembly and association, and the right to<br>
&gt; security. An end-user who is denied access to certain services,<br>
&gt; data or websites may be unable to disclose vital information about<br>
&gt; the malpractices of a government or other authority.=C2=A0 A person<br=
>
&gt; whose communications are monitored may be prevented from<br>
&gt; exercising their right to freedom of association. In a worst-case<br>
&gt; scenario, protocols that leak information can lead to physical<br>
&gt; danger. A realistic example to consider is when opposition leaders<br>
&gt; in totalitarian regimes are subjected to torture on the basis of<br>
&gt; information gathered by the regime through information leakage in<br>
&gt; protocols.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; This sections details several =E2=80=98common=E2=80=99 threats to huma=
n rights,<br>
&gt; indicating how each of these can lead to human rights<br>
&gt; violations/harms and present several examples of how these threats<br>
&gt; to human rights materialize on the Internet. This threat modeling<br>
&gt; is inspired by {{RFC6973}} Privacy Considerations for Internet<br>
&gt; Protocols, which bases itself on security threat analysis. This<br>
&gt; method is by no means a perfect solution for assessing human rights<br=
>
&gt; risks in Internet protocols and systems; it is however the best<br>
&gt; approach currently available. Certain human rights threats are<br>
&gt; indirectly considered in Internet protocols as part of the standard<br=
>
&gt; privacy and security considerations. Others suggested are tailored<br>
&gt; specifically to human rights, and represents considerations not<br>
&gt; currently considered in other RFCs.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Many threats, enablers and risks are linked to different rights.<br>
&gt; This is not unsurprising if one takes into account that human<br>
&gt; rights are interrelated, interdependent and universal. Here however<br=
>
&gt; we&#39;re not discussing all human rights because not all human rights=
<br>
&gt; are relevant to ICTs in general and protocols and standards in<br>
&gt; particular. This is by no means an attempt to cherry picks right,<br>
&gt; if other rights seem relevant, please contact the authors and/or<br>
&gt; the hrpc mailinglist.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; ### Human Rights Guidelines<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; This section provides guidance for document authors in the form of<br>
&gt; a questionnaire about a protocol being designed. The questionnaire<br>
&gt; may be useful at any point in the design process, particularly<br>
&gt; after document authors have developed a high-level protocol model<br>
&gt; as described in {{RFC4101}}.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Note that the guidance provided in this section does not recommend<br>
&gt; specific practices.=C2=A0 The range of protocols developed in the IETF=
<br>
&gt; is too broad to make recommendations about particular uses of data<br>
&gt; or how human rights might be balanced against other design goals.<br>
&gt; However, by carefully considering the answers to each question,<br>
&gt; document authors should be able to produce a comprehensive analysis<br=
>
&gt; that can serve as the basis for discussion of whether the protocol<br>
&gt; adequately protects against human rights threats.=C2=A0 This guidance =
is<br>
&gt; meant to help the thought process of a human rights analysis; it<br>
&gt; does not provide specific directions for how to write a human<br>
&gt; rights protocol considerations section (following the example set<br>
&gt; in {{RFC6973}}).<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; #### Right to freedom of expression<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; ##### Connectivity Does your protocol honor the end-to-end<br>
&gt; principle?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; ##### Privacy Did you have a look at the Guidelines in the Privacy<br>
&gt; Considerations for Internet Protocols {{RFC6973}} section 7? Does<br>
&gt; your protocol in any way impact the confidentiality of protocol<br>
&gt; metadata? Does your protocol countering traffic analysis, or data<br>
&gt; minimisation?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; ##### Security Did you have a look at Guidelines for Writing RFC<br>
&gt; Text on Security Considerations {{RFC3552}}?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; ##### Content agnosticism If your protocol impact packet handling,<br>
&gt; does it look at the packet content? Is it making decisions based on<br=
>
&gt; the content of the packet? Is the protocol transparent about its<br>
&gt; decision? Does your protocol prioritize certain content or services<br=
>
&gt; over others?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; ##### Internationalization Does your protocol have text string that<br=
>
&gt; are readable or entered by humans? Does your protocol allow Unicode<br=
>
&gt; encoded in UTF-8 only, thereby shifting conversion issues away from<br=
>
&gt; individual choices? Did you have a look at {{RFC6365}}?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; ##### Censorship resistance Does your protocol make censorship<br>
&gt; easier by exposing specific identifiers that could be sensitive for<br=
>
&gt; filtering. When filtering is happening, does your protocol help<br>
&gt; make it apparent or transparent?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; ##### Open Standards Is your protocol fully documented in a way<br>
&gt; that it could be easily implemented, improved, build upon and/or<br>
&gt; further developed. Is there any proprietary code needed for the<br>
&gt; implementation, running or further development of your protocol?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; ##### Heterogeneity Support Does your protocol support<br>
&gt; heterogeneity by design? Does your protocol allow for multiple<br>
&gt; types of hardware? Does your protocol allow for multiple types of<br>
&gt; application protocols?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; #### Right to non-discrimination<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; ##### Anonymity Did you have a look at the Privacy Considerations<br>
&gt; for Internet Protocols {{RFC6973}}, especially section 6.1.1 ?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; ##### Privacy See above<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; ##### Pseudonymity Did you have a look at the Privacy<br>
&gt; Considerations for Internet Protocols {{RFC6973}}, especially<br>
&gt; section 6.1.2 ?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; ##### Content agnosticism See above<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; ##### Accessibility Is your protocol optimized for low bandwidth<br>
&gt; and high latency connections? Could your protocol also be developed<br=
>
&gt; in a stateless manner ?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; #### Right to equal protection<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; ##### Content agnosticism See above<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; #### Right to be presumed innocent Is is possible to deploy your<br>
&gt; protocol without a single point of control? If applicable, can it<br>
&gt; also implemented in a federated way?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; ##### Anonymity See above<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; ##### Privacy See above<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; ##### Security See above<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; #### Right to political participation<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; ##### Accessibility when websites, web technologies, or web tools<br>
&gt; are badly designed, they can create barriers that exclude people<br>
&gt; from using the Web. Is your protocol designed to provide an<br>
&gt; enabling environment for people with disabilities? It might be<br>
&gt; relevant to look at the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative for<br>
&gt; examples and guidance.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; ##### Internationalization See above<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; ##### Censorship resistance See above<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; #### Right to participate in cultural life, arts and science<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; ##### Open Standards See above<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; ##### Localization Does your protocol live up to standards of<br>
&gt; internationalization (see above)? Have you considered localizing<br>
&gt; your protocol for relevant audiences?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; ##### Internationalization See above<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; ##### Censorship resistance See above<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; #### Right to freedom of assembly and association<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; ##### Connectivity See above<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; ##### Decentralization Does your protocol contribute to more<br>
&gt; centralized points of control? Can your protocol be implemented<br>
&gt; without one single point of control. If applicable, can your<br>
&gt; protocol be deployed in a federated manner?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; ##### Censorship resistance See above<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; ##### Pseudonymity See above<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; ##### Anonymity See above<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; #### Security See above<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; #### Right to security<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; ##### Reliability Is your protocol fault tolerant? Does it degrade<br>
&gt; gracefully? Do you have a documented way to announce degradation?<br>
&gt; Do you have measures in place for recovery or partial healing from<br>
&gt; failure? Is your protocol able to maintain dependability and<br>
&gt; performance in the face of unanticipated changes or circumstances?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; ##### Confidentiality (cf {{RFC6973}} ) Which information related<br>
&gt; to identifiers or data=C2=A0 is exposed to each other protocol entity<=
br>
&gt; (i.e., recipients, intermediaries, and enablers)?=C2=A0 Are there ways=
<br>

&gt; limit the information shared with each entity?<br>
&gt;<br>

&gt; require before personal data or identifiers are shared or exposed<br>
&gt; via the protocol?=C2=A0 If no such mechanisms or controls are specifie=
d,<br>
&gt; is it expected that control and consent will be handled outside of<br>
&gt; the protoco l?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Does the protocol provide ways for initiators to share different<br>
&gt; information with different recipients?=C2=A0 If not, are there<br>
&gt; mechanisms that exist outside of the protocol to provide initiators<br=

Hello,

I am new to the list, but due to preliminary discussion it seems that
this would be the right place to submit an idea for possible examination.=


Last year I wrote a MSc thesis to the University of Helsinki about an
idea of a censorship-resistant Web that I've plaid with in my mind for
long. The thesis was approved, but my supervisor never really commented
on the idea itself.
I thought that if the idea would've been deemed feasible, it would've
been thoroughly discussed; and because it wasn't, there probably was no
potential in it.

However, it has kept bugging me that there haven't really been many
studies that would satisfy all the properties that a
censorship-resistant should have to become widely adopted. It may be
that my idea similarly fails to satisfy the requirements, or that it is
not feasible at all, but I felt that I should at least pass it forward
for someone else to decide. So if you have time and interest, I'd be
glad to hear any opinions about it.

The thesis is named "Static Web content distribution and request routing
in a P2P overlay" and can be found from: http://hdl.handle.net/10138/1566=
68
High-level description of the idea begins from page 80, chapter 4, named
"HTTP2P Overlay".

As I assume it would be a long read to go through the whole text with
thought, I'll try to compress a TL;DR version below:

 - The Internet has mostly evolved on client/server-model. This can be
seen in many protocol designs, including HTTP.
 -> As a result, Internet censorship is possible in its current extent.
 - Several solutions exist to circumvent censorship, but they are
dependent on external applications and infrastructures; and additionally
appear to be a constant race between individual developers and the
censoring entities.
 -> Accessing information in the Internet should not require any special
CS competence despite of any censorship in place.

 - To deal with the root cause of the issue, a solution is needed that
is transparent, privacy-preserving (in a sense that it at least isn't
worse than the current situation) and that would set a very high price
for successful censorship.
 - To become widely adopted, the solution should benefit all parites of
the Internet ecosystem, including ISPs, content providers and the end-use=
rs.

=3D> So why not develop a P2P HTTP extension (!=3D Coral CDN) that would =
not
only allow access to static resources, but would enable two-way
communication with the Web server, thus enabling fully dynamic content
to the P2P-based requests as well.

All the required technologies already exist, they just need to be
combined in a way that can overcome the P2P-related caveats. I think
such could be achievable with a hybrid P2P construct that has remote
resemblance with CAN P2P-overlay design. In the thesis I speak of HTTP2P
as I envisioned it could be made completely transparent to the end-user,
only requiring the URL to be typed in a form "http2p://www.example.com".

Hopefully the idea at least raises further ideas if nothing else.


Best Regards,
Mikael Svenn

>=20

Agree. It should have never been mentioned under Right to be Presumed
Innocent directly but always under a technical subheader, so removed,
but added the subhead 'decentralization' under the Right to be
Presumed Innocent.

>=20

I don't disagree, but I'm not sure whether DPI policies fall within
the purview of the IETF / IRTF. How we could fix this is add 'Content
Agnosticism' as a subheading under the Right to be Presumed Innocent,
but I'm not sure how that would be stronger (or more elaborate) than
privacy.

>=20

Agree, so adding 'Content agnosticism" (as well as 'Decentralization')
to Right to be presumed innocent.
I understand your point much better now. Corinne and I will redo the
considerations list because offlist I also got quite some comments
that the current structure is not helpful (there are too many 'see
above's'.

So what we'll do is that we leave the different technical
considerations (anonymity, privacy, content agnosticism, etc) and in
brackets put the rights they're related to behind them.

>=20

>=20

Nice! I've added 'What is the potential for discrimination against
users of your protocol? How can use of your protocol be used to
implicate users?' to 'decentralization', but somehow I feel these
questions would also fit under privacy or anonymity. What do you think?

For the moment I'll leave it here.

Cheers,

Niels
