Hi,

Thanks for your work on this. I have missed the initial discussions but =
have a few thoughts to offer. I=92m also more used to thinking about =
chartering in the IETF than in the IRTF, but I=92m sure Lars will put me =
in line if that bias is too much reflected in my comments below. :)

I like the idea for this research group, but I think it would have a =
better chance of success if it were more tightly scoped. I would suggest =
focusing on the specific rights of most interest initially, and then =
perhaps re-chartering to focus on different rights later. The two that =
are named are freedom of expression and freedom of association, and =
those seem like good initial candidates. I think this would be helpful =
because the analysis of the impact of standards and protocols on =
different rights could be vastly different from each other, so it seems =
to make more sense to think about them one at a time. This could also =
help distinguish the work in this group from some other efforts in the =
IETF related to privacy, by making it clear that the focus is on other =
specific rights. I would also suggest sticking to the human rights =
framing, rather than talking about user rights, which can have a =
different connotation for some people.=20

It depends on the context. Users' rights are sometimes the highest
priority, but sometimes their individual rights are in conflict with
that of the society. So often it is good to let users have at least
a choice and let them decide.

Not sure, connectivity is also mentioned as being part of
freedom of expression on slide 14. This refers more to
information sharing and distribution, while accessibility
is an important means for both sides the producers and the
consumers of information.

Regards,
 Roland

Hi,

The guidelines to protect are mean to be parallel to the guidelines 
regard to privacy published in RFC 6973, things that could be taken into
account by protocol designers in the same way, as you mention, as other
engineering tradeoff considerations.  Perhaps we can use the same sort
of language guidelines for considering the human rights of  freedom of
expression and association in protocol design.  This sort of specificity
may also serve as a response to Alissa's comments.

Hi,

I think it does make sense to be consistent about human rights through
out the document.  Perhaps we should change the end-users rights at the
end to human rights.

In terms of connectivity being a human right.  There has been much
discussion on it.  You are certainly right that it was not mentioned in
the UDHR or even in the other documents included in the International
Bill of Human Rights (UNGA res  217 A (III)) including the International
Covenant of civil and Political rights (CCPR) as well as the
International  Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR).

Frank La Rue made the  point of the critical relationship between human
rights and the Internet  in his report in May of 2011.  This is neither
a UN resolution not is it binding in any way.  It has, however,  been
accepted a point of departure for the broader discussion.

    20.
    Indeed, the Internet has become a key means by which individuals can
    exercise their
         right to freedom of opinion and expression, as guaranteed by
    article 19 of the Universal
    Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil
    and Political Rights.

I do not think that this research work requires that we resolve this
issue of whether it is, formally speaking, a human rights or not.  As I
read the charter, it does not explicitly state that it is a right. 
Rather it says:

- is essential for rights
- that human rights lie at the basis of,

This avoids declaring that they are human rights, but does indicate they
are important in respect to human rights.

I might change the first sentence to read: "... to research how
standards can enable or threaten human rights values."

comments on my changes here: 1) we don't want to know just "whether",
but the ways these things can happen, right?; 2) "solidify" seemed a
bit of a strange word to use so I suggest dropping it... maybe the
intent here was more about "supporting" human rights? If that is
sufficiently distinct from "enabling" then maybe use "support" here?;
3) is it the rights we're interested in or the values that cluster
around different rights?  I think by getting to "human rights values"
you may be able to tackle in a more tractable manner things like
"right of connectivity" that Avri helpfully outlined in her email
earlier today.

I'm not sure how "decisive" works above grammatically. You could
probably just drop "decisive and" here with no ill effect, right? If
not, what is a "decisive characteristic of the Internet"?

It's also not immediately clear to me how not defining human rights
implications of protocols will result in a loss of functionality or
connectivity... maybe there's something missing in there about how
"not elucidating the interplay between protocols and human rights
values may result in a limited or even hostile internet experience for
some users"?

I think you can drop "this makes a clear case that" to make that last
bit more crisp. I would recommend "human rights values" here too, but
this may just be my own weirdo perspective (I'll shut up about that
now!).

I'm wondering if things like the I-D series we are working on at CDT
might be appropriate outputs for the HRPC group? Happy to discuss, of
course: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-hall-censorship-tech/
Or are these more about publishing regular documents that track the
progress and work of HRPC?

I may be the only mixed methods researcher in the group, but wondering
if there is any qualitative analysis of this work planned? Happy to
say more.

This sounds very neat, and ambitious! I had thought Nick Doty (UC
Berkeley, W3C) had done some language analysis of W3C standards WGs...
might want to invite his thoughts on doing this for IETF work.

I don't think the rights to free expression and free association can be
cleanly separated from privacy.  Privacy is an enabler of both free
expression and free association, no?

I agree that we should use "human rights" throughout.  "user rights" is
not only unclear, but it is more limited in scope.  It's possible that
protocols have rights implications for humans who are not users of these
protocols (as a contrived example, a protocol defining how to operate an
online version of a national parliament could have consequences for the
rights of all the people in the nation, though only the members of
parliament might be "users" of such a system).

True, they certainly have a relationship, but I still think the work =
would benefit from a clear framing. There are aspects of privacy that =
have only a tenuous relationship to the other rights (e.g., the =
intrusion threat discussed in RFC 6973) and if the work is really aimed =

On the other hand, if the intent was to focus specifically on privacy, =
then I might wonder about the relationship between this group=92s work =
and other past and present work in the IETF and the IAB.

Hi all,

The point we tried to make is that RFC1958 states:

   2.1 Many members of the Internet community would argue that there is
   no architecture, but only a tradition, which was not written down for
   the first 25 years (or at least not by the IAB).  However, in very
   general terms, the community believes that the goal is connectivity,
   the tool is the Internet Protocol, and the intelligence is end to end
   rather than hidden in the network.

and further down:

   The key to global connectivity is the inter-networking layer.  The
   key to exploiting this layer over diverse hardware providing global
   connectivity is the "end to end argument".

So the concepts of global connectivity arises from RFC1958, not from
any suggestions we made (or Frank la Rue for that matter :). . The
point I tried to make there was the strong resemblance between the
human rights and these principles.

But to make sure it's clear: I completely agree with both Alvaro and
Avri that the question whether Internet Access is a human right is not
something we would need to solver in this RG.

But Stephen was probably right that stating that Human Rights are
ingrained in the network might have been a bit too strong. Will adapt
and come back with new proposed text soon.

Best,

Niels

This might be a remnant of not being a native English speaker, the aim
was to say:

1. enable (create rights (enabling) space where it not was before)
2. solidify, or alternatively: strengthen (improve existing rights)
3. threaten (harm rights)

I would prefer strengthen over support, because it sounds a bit
stronger, but am happy to hear from native speakers what they think is be=
st.

In the next version I'll propose: "enable, strengthen or threaten human
rights,"

>=20

If we move from rights to values, we are getting on a slippery slope.
There is international agreement on what human rights are, not what
human rights values are. Am afraid we are adding more moving parts in
this discussion if we add 'values'.

Furthermore I think an initial focus on freedom of expression and
freedom of association (as is mentioned in the ID and also proposed by
Alissa) would provide us with sufficient work for the coming time.

>=20

This refers a bit back to slide 8 of the presentation we done in Dallas
(attached). There assumption is that there are decisive architectural
principles (such a interoperability, end to end principle, etc) and also
enable human rights. The assumption is also that there are also decisive
architectural principles that do not impact human rights (such a the
'good enough principle').

>=20

I will try to improve that language as well.

I rewrote this text, will come back with a whole new proposal after this.=

This would be great, I would greatly welcome this work as part of the
research group.

Currently Corinne is indeed working on a paper based on these interviews.=

That would be great, my progress on this has been relatively minimal,
would be very happy to discuss this further with Nick. Would you be so
kind to make introductions (or invite him to the list)?

Ah, this makes sense to me now, after you've elaborated a bit in the

document at some point that would be great (but I'll look at the new

This is still not clear to me at all. I'll go check those slides and
try and propose an edit in the next week or so that might make this
more clear.

Will do!

== Sorry for sending an earlier version of this to the old list,
reposting it here. Please reply on this list, thanks Joe for pointing
this out. ==

Dear all,

Thank you all very much for your thoughtful comments. I have tried to
incorporate them all in the text underneath. I thought it would make
most sense to create a new thread with the new text to ensure everyone
can follow where we are now.

This brings me to a questions where I would really like to profit from
the wisdom of the experienced crowd here: what is the best way to do
version control and manage ID / charter / RFC development?
Is it done mostly on the list (and then subsequently edited by the
main editors, like we're doing now), or do people use git, etherpads
and/or Google Docs to do collaborative editing and commenting?

It would be great to hear what the best practices are for this, or
simply your preferred methods. I am still learning in this space, so
all advise and corrections are very welcome.

Please find the next iteration of the proposed text here, looking
forward to your comments and suggestions:

Background
The Human Rights Protocol Consideration Proposed Research Group is
chartered to research whether standards and protocols can enable,
strengthen or threaten human rights, as defined in the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) [0], specifically the right to
freedom of expression and freedom of assembly.

The research group takes as its starting point the problem statement
that decisive and human rights enabling characteristics of the
Internet might be degraded if they're not properly defined, described
and sufficiently taken into account in protocol development. Not
protecting these characteristics could result in (partial) loss of
functionality and connectivity.

As stated in RFC 1958, the Internet aims to be the global network of
networks that provides unfettered connectivity to all users at all
times and for any content. Open, secure and reliable connectivity is
essential for rights such as freedom of expression and freedom of
association, as defined in the UDHR. Therefore, considering
connectivity as the ultimate objective of the network, the Internet is
not only an enabler of human rights, but that there is a strong
overlap between the architecture of the network and human rights.

Concerns for freedom of expression and association were a strong part
of the world-view of the community involved in developing the first
Internet protocols. The Internet was designed with freedom and
openness of communications as core values. But as the scale and the
industrialization of the Internet has grown greatly, the influence of
such world-views started to compete with other values. This research
group aims to expose the relations between human rights and protocols
and provide guidelines to ensure informed future protocol development
and decision making where protocols might influence the right to
freedom of expression or association.

Objective
This research aims to expose the relation between protocols and human
rights, specifically the right to freedom of expression and freedom of
assembly and propose guidelines to protect the Internet as rights
enabling environment in future protocol development in a manner
similar to the work done for RFC 6973 on Privacy Consideration
Guidelines,

Outputs
The research group plans on using  a variety of research methods to
create different outputs including (but not limited to):

- - Internet drafts - (some of which may be put on IRSG RFC track)
These would concern tracking of the project, methodology, and would
define any possible protocol considerations.

- - Policy and academic papers
For in depth analysis and discussion on the relationship between human
rights and the Internet architecture and protocols.

- - Film and paper based on interviews with members of the community
To give an accessible insight into the variety of opinions on this
topic represented in the community.

- - Data analysis and visualization
To research and visualize the language used in current and historic
RFCs and mailinglist discussions to expose core architectural
principles and language and deliberations on end-user and human rights.

- - Raising awareness
Improving the awareness in both the human rights community and the
technical community on the importance of the technical workings of the
Internet and how that may impact human rights.

Membership
Membership is open to any interested parties who intend to remain
current with the published documents and mailing list issues.

Hi Niels and others,

Great work! I just wanted to suggest we strengthen the justification for
taking the UDHR as the basis for defining human rights. Although it seems
obvious (closest thing we have to universal set of guidelines on human
rights etc) the universality of these principles is more contested than we
(in the Global North) like to admit. I think it strengthens our point of
view to acknowledge this, as it is a point that was raised both during the
meeting in Dallas and in the interviews.

Best,

Corinne

<br>
Thank you all very much for your thoughtful comments. I have tried to<br>
incorporate them all in the text underneath. I thought it would make<br>
most sense to create a new thread with the new text to ensure everyone<br>
can follow where we are now.<br>

the wisdom of the experienced crowd here: what is the best way to do<br>
version control and manage ID / charter / RFC development?<br>
Is it done mostly on the list (and then subsequently edited by the<br>
main editors, like we&#39;re doing now), or do people use git, etherpads<br=
>
and/or Google Docs to do collaborative editing and commenting?<br>
<br>
It would be great to hear what the best practices are for this, or<br>
simply your preferred methods. I am still learning in this space, so<br>
all advise and corrections are very welcome.<br>
<br>
Please find the next iteration of the proposed text here, looking<br>
forward to your comments and suggestions:<br>
<br>
Background<br>
The Human Rights Protocol Consideration Proposed Research Group is<br>
chartered to research whether standards and protocols can enable,<br>
strengthen or threaten human rights, as defined in the Universal<br>
Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) [0], specifically the right to<br>
freedom of expression and freedom of assembly.<br>
<br>
The research group takes as its starting point the problem statement<br>
that decisive and human rights enabling characteristics of the<br>
Internet might be degraded if they&#39;re not properly defined, described<b=
r>
and sufficiently taken into account in protocol development. Not<br>
protecting these characteristics could result in (partial) loss of<br>
functionality and connectivity.<br>
<br>
As stated in RFC 1958, the Internet aims to be the global network of<br>
networks that provides unfettered connectivity to all users at all<br>
times and for any content. Open, secure and reliable connectivity is<br>
essential for rights such as freedom of expression and freedom of<br>
association, as defined in the UDHR. Therefore, considering<br>
connectivity as the ultimate objective of the network, the Internet is<br>
not only an enabler of human rights, but that there is a strong<br>
overlap between the architecture of the network and human rights.<br>
<br>
Concerns for freedom of expression and association were a strong part<br>
of the world-view of the community involved in developing the first<br>
Internet protocols. The Internet was designed with freedom and<br>
openness of communications as core values. But as the scale and the<br>
industrialization of the Internet has grown greatly, the influence of<br>
such world-views started to compete with other values. This research<br>
group aims to expose the relations between human rights and protocols<br>
and provide guidelines to ensure informed future protocol development<br>
and decision making where protocols might influence the right to<br>
freedom of expression or association.<br>
<br>
Objective<br>
This research aims to expose the relation between protocols and human<br>
rights, specifically the right to freedom of expression and freedom of<br>
assembly and propose guidelines to protect the Internet as rights<br>
enabling environment in future protocol development in a manner<br>
similar to the work done for RFC 6973 on Privacy Consideration<br>
Guidelines,<br>
<br>
Outputs<br>
The research group plans on using=C2=A0 a variety of research methods to<br=
>
create different outputs including (but not limited to):<br>
<br>
- - Internet drafts - (some of which may be put on IRSG RFC track)<br>
These would concern tracking of the project, methodology, and would<br>
define any possible protocol considerations.<br>
<br>
- - Policy and academic papers<br>
For in depth analysis and discussion on the relationship between human<br>
rights and the Internet architecture and protocols.<br>
<br>
- - Film and paper based on interviews with members of the community<br>
To give an accessible insight into the variety of opinions on this<br>
topic represented in the community.<br>
<br>
- - Data analysis and visualization<br>
To research and visualize the language used in current and historic<br>
RFCs and mailinglist discussions to expose core architectural<br>
principles and language and deliberations on end-user and human rights.<br>
<br>
- - Raising awareness<br>
Improving the awareness in both the human rights community and the<br>
technical community on the importance of the technical workings of the<br>
Internet and how that may impact human rights.<br>

Hi All.
I just subscribed to the list and Niels suggested that I introduce myself.

First and foremost I am glad to be on board - this is an interesting and
important project.
I come from an international law/international human rights law background
(academia - currently working @ Qatar University). I have been studying the
relationship of international law & human rights with the digital sphere
and following the IETF's work for a couple of years now. I came to
appreciate a lot the technical point of view on many issues. (I just
finished a paper on understanding online privacy both as a technical and a
human rights issues, in case anyone is interested. I attach it here but I
understand that it does not fall within the remit of this group).

A few points on the draft, if I may:
1. whether mention should be made to the ICCPR - besides the UDHR. The UDHR
is indeed the document embodying, to the extent possible, a universal
consensus on human rights issues but it is non-binding. The International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) is the universal, most
widely ratified treaty (hence binding document). ICANN mentions ICCPR
alongside the UDHR in the gTLDs.

2. I too would suggest avoiding terms as ''values''. "Human rights" (or
"interests", if needed) read better avoiding debates or unclarity.

3. the draft reads "where protocols might influence the rights...". It
could be rephrased: "where protocols impact the effective exercise of the
rights.."

4. in the Objective section it reads "guidelines to protect". I agree with
some earlier comments that it would be better if we talked about guidelines
to inform and be considered in protocol design.


Thanks,
Adamantia

of years now. I came to appreciate a lot the technical point of view on man=
y issues. (I just finished a paper on understanding online privacy both as =
a technical and a human rights issues, in case anyone is interested. I atta=
ch it here but I understand that it does not fall within the remit of this =
group).</div><div><br></div><div>A few points on the draft, if I may:=C2=A0=
</div><div>1. whether mention should be made to the ICCPR - besides the UDH=
R. The UDHR is indeed the document embodying, to the extent possible, a uni=
versal consensus on human rights issues but it is non-binding. The Internat=
ional Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) is the universal, most=
 widely ratified treaty (hence binding document). ICANN mentions ICCPR alon=
gside the UDHR in the gTLDs.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>2. I too would =
suggest avoiding terms as &#39;&#39;values&#39;&#39;. &quot;Human rights&qu=
ot; (or &quot;interests&quot;, if needed) read better avoiding debates or u=
nclarity.</div><div><br></div><div>3. the draft reads &quot;where protocols=
 might influence the rights...&quot;. It could be rephrased: &quot;where pr=
otocols impact the effective exercise of the rights..&quot;</div><div><br><=
/div><div>4. in the Objective section it reads &quot;guidelines to protect&=
quot;. I agree with some earlier comments that it would be better if we tal=
ked about guidelines to inform and be considered in protocol design.=C2=A0<=

&gt; Great work! I just wanted to suggest we strengthen the<br>

Integration of the comments made by Adamantia:


Background
The Human Rights Protocol Consideration Proposed Research Group is
chartered to research whether standards and protocols can enable,
strengthen or threaten human rights, as defined in the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) [0] and the International Covenant
on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) [1], specifically the right to
freedom of expression and freedom of assembly.

The research group takes as its starting point the problem statement
that decisive and human rights enabling characteristics of the
Internet might be degraded if they're not properly defined, described
and sufficiently taken into account in protocol development. Not
protecting these characteristics could result in (partial) loss of
functionality and connectivity.

As stated in RFC 1958, the Internet aims to be the global network of
networks that provides unfettered connectivity to all users at all
times and for any content. Open, secure and reliable connectivity is
essential for rights such as freedom of expression and freedom of
association, as defined in the UDHR. Therefore, considering
connectivity as the ultimate objective of the network, the Internet is
not only an enabler of human rights, but that there is a strong
overlap between the architecture of the network and human rights.

Concerns for freedom of expression and association were a strong part
of the world-view of the community involved in developing the first
Internet protocols. The Internet was designed with freedom and
openness of communications as core values. But as the scale and the
industrialization of the Internet has grown greatly, the influence of
such world-views started to compete with other values. This research
group aims to expose the relations between human rights and protocols
and provide guidelines to ensure informed future protocol development
and decision making where protocols impact the effective excercise of
the rights to freedom of expression or association.

Objective
This research aims to expose the relation between protocols and human
rights, specifically the right to freedom of expression and freedom of
assembly and propose guidelines to protect the Internet as rights
enabling environment in future protocol development in a manner
similar to the work done for RFC 6973 on Privacy Consideration
Guidelines,

Outputs
The research group plans on using  a variety of research methods to
create different outputs including (but not limited to):

- - Internet drafts - (some of which may be put on IRSG RFC track)
These would concern tracking of the project, methodology, and would
define any possible protocol considerations.

- - Policy and academic papers
For in depth analysis and discussion on the relationship between human
rights and the Internet architecture and protocols.

- - Film and paper based on interviews with members of the community
To give an accessible insight into the variety of opinions on this
topic represented in the community.

- - Data analysis and visualization
To research and visualize the language used in current and historic
RFCs and mailinglist discussions to expose core architectural
principles and language and deliberations on end-user and human rights.

- - Raising awareness
Improving the awareness in both the human rights community and the
technical community on the importance of the technical workings of the
Internet and how that may impact human rights.

Membership
Membership is open to any interested parties who intend to remain
current with the published documents and mailing list issues.

I would like to push back a bit here. We have similar text in the
background:

[quote]
This research group aims to expose the relations between human rights
and protocols and provide guidelines to ensure informed future
protocol development and decision making where protocols impact the
effective excercise of the rights to freedom of expression or association=
=2E
[/quote]

I think the current objective text is quite clear. The fact that we
are proposing guidelines already implies that they are there to inform
and be considered in protocol design, right? This is even reinforced
by the link to RFC 6973.

Or would you rather have the following?

[quote]

rights, specifically the right to freedom of expression and freedom of
assembly and propose guidelines to inform and be considered in

for RFC 6973 on Privacy Consideration Guidelines,
[/quote]

Not really convinced (yet) this makes the objective clearer of more
convincing.

Best,

Hi Niels and other hrpc'ers --

Looking good!  a few grammar/language nit-picks below, and a bit more
pushback against limiting ourselves to the freedoms of expression and
assembly.

On Fri 2015-05-08 09:41:13 -0400, Niels ten Oever wrote:

You've got singular/pluralmaybe change "the right to" to "the rights
to", since these are two freedoms.  Do we really want to leave privacy
(article 12 of UDHR) out of this list?  what about other rights that may
be impacted as society moves more online, like taking part in government
(article 21 of UDHR) in this age of twitter-moderated public service?
Maybe we could say "specifically, but not limited to" ?

> The research group takes as its starting point the problem statement

I feel like this compound modifier needs some hyphenation, but i'm not
sure what the right thing to do is.  maybe:

  decisive and human-rights-enabling characteristics 

??

I know it's not much of a style guide, but:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#Compound_modifiers

> Open, secure and reliable connectivity is essential for rights such as
> freedom of expression and freedom of association, as defined in the

why mention UDHR again here?  can we just drop "as defined in the UDHR"?

This whole sentence is a bit awkward: the parallels aren't quite
parallel, and it tries to connecti things together that don't quite
match up aesthetically.  how about:

   Since the Internet's objective of connectivity makes it an enabler of
   human rights, its architectural design overlaps with the frameworks
   we use to define and discuss human rights.

should be "and to provide guidelines"

> to ensure informed future protocol development and decision making

how about "to inform future protocol development and decision making" here ?

this kind of trailed off here -- is that last comma intended to be a
period?  And again, we're limiting ourselves to just the expression and
assembly, though i think other factors may be relevant too.  The
constructions here are a little awkward too.  Maybe we could break this
out into two bullets to make the section clearer?

   This research has two major aims:

    - to expose the relation between protocols and human rights, with a
      focus on the rights to freedom of expression and freedom of
      assembly, and

    - to propose guidelines to protect the Internet as a rights-enabling
      environment in future protocol development, in a manner similar to
      the work done for Privacy Considerations in RFC 6973

"Film and paper based on interviews" should be "Film and textual
interviews"

I'd replace the last "in the community" with "within the IETF" to avoid
repetition.

we're sneaking "end-user rights" back in here at the very end.  do we
ant that?  how about "...deliberations on human rights of those affected
by the network."

> Improving the awareness in both the human rights community and the

This last bit should be "and its impact on human rights."

Niels, the only issue is that one could read into "guidelines to protect"
that the protection of the Internet as a human rights enabling environment
is the intended end result. As Mallory noted too, I am not sure that this
is the case. The guidelines are supposed to inform and taken into account
alongside other considerations and the designers are to decide, if needed,
any necessary trade-offs.


Thanks,
Adamantia

I would like to push back a bit here. We have similar text in the
background:

[quote]
This research group aims to expose the relations between human rights
and protocols and provide guidelines to ensure informed future
protocol development and decision making where protocols impact the
effective excercise of the rights to freedom of expression or association.
[/quote]

I think the current objective text is quite clear. The fact that we
are proposing guidelines already implies that they are there to inform
and be considered in protocol design, right? This is even reinforced
by the link to RFC 6973.

Or would you rather have the following?

[quote]

rights, specifically the right to freedom of expression and freedom of
assembly and propose guidelines to inform and be considered in

Not really convinced (yet) this makes the objective clearer of more
convincing.

&gt; law/international human rights law background (academia - currently<br=
>
&gt; working @ Qatar University). I have been studying the relationship<br>
&gt; of international law &amp; human rights with the digital sphere and<br=
>
&gt; following the IETF&#39;s work for a couple of years now. I came to<br>
&gt; appreciate a lot the technical point of view on many issues. (I<br>
&gt; just finished a paper on understanding online privacy both as a<br>
&gt; technical and a human rights issues, in case anyone is interested.<br>
&gt; I attach it here but I understand that it does not fall within the<br>
&gt; remit of this group).<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; A few points on the draft, if I may: 1. whether mention should be<br>
&gt; made to the ICCPR - besides the UDHR. The UDHR is indeed the<br>
&gt; document embodying, to the extent possible, a universal consensus<br>
&gt; on human rights issues but it is non-binding. The International<br>
&gt; Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) is the universal,<br>
&gt; most widely ratified treaty (hence binding document). ICANN<br>
&gt; mentions ICCPR alongside the UDHR in the gTLDs.<br>
<br>
</span>Great point will add it to the draft charter.<br>
<span class=3D""><br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; 2. I too would suggest avoiding terms as &#39;&#39;values&#39;&#39;. &=
quot;Human rights&quot;<br>
&gt; (or &quot;interests&quot;, if needed) read better avoiding debates or<=
br>
&gt; unclarity.<br>
&gt;<br>
<br>
</span>+1<br>
<span class=3D""><br>
&gt; 3. the draft reads &quot;where protocols might influence the rights...=
&quot;.<br>
&gt; It could be rephrased: &quot;where protocols impact the effective<br>
&gt; exercise of the rights..&quot;<br>
&gt;<br>
<br>
</span>Will add.<br>
<span class=3D""><br>
&gt; 4. in the Objective section it reads &quot;guidelines to protect&quot;=
. I<br>
&gt; agree with some earlier comments that it would be better if we<br>
&gt; talked about guidelines to inform and be considered in protocol<br>
&gt; design.<br>
&gt;<br>
<br>
</span>I would like to push back a bit here. We have similar text in the<br=
>
background:<br>
<br>
[quote]<br>
This research group aims to expose the relations between human rights<br>
and protocols and provide guidelines to ensure informed future<br>
protocol development and decision making where protocols impact the<br>
effective excercise of the rights to freedom of expression or association.<=
br>
[/quote]<br>
<br>
I think the current objective text is quite clear. The fact that we<br>
are proposing guidelines already implies that they are there to inform<br>
and be considered in protocol design, right? This is even reinforced<br>
by the link to RFC 6973.<br>
<br>
Or would you rather have the following?<br>

for RFC 6973 on Privacy Consideration Guidelines,<br>

Not really convinced (yet) this makes the objective clearer of more<br>

Hi all,

Great comments so far!

I wrote i small bit to counter the criticism we have been getting for using
the UDHR.

looking forward to your feedback on the content of the text, or if it
should be added at all.


The authors are aware that although the UDHR is the closest statement of a
global set of universal values, these values are not necessarily absolute
as they are open to interpretation within different national jurisdictions.
In full recognition of the fact that the debate on these values continues,
that their interpretation is context dependent and often contentious, the
group holds that, at this point in time, they are an appropriate departure
point as they are the most complete overarching human rights framework and
most legitimate set of globally shared human rights principles.

Hi Corinne,

Thanks for this. I think this is a bit too long, especially for the
charter. I also have some specific comments inline:

I wouldn't use about 'the authors', but rather 'the research group'

Furthermore I think we're confusing 'universal' and 'absolute'.
Historically human rights are exactly the instrument invented to
counter absolutism, human rights are there to limit the power of
states and to defend the rights of individuals.

The concept of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is that these
rights are universal. And since the overwhelming majority of countries
is a member of the main human rights treaties, I think it is not hard
to defend the universality of these principals.

My main problem is that this paragraph implies that human rights are
more contentious than they in fact are in terms of national and
international law. This is not only a matter of states, it is an
obligation of every state to uphold human rights, but all human beings
and entities should respect human rights (hence the UN Guiding
Principles on Business to Respect Human Rights).

>=20

The largest criticism of specific member states is that there are
traditional values that might not be in line with human rights. There
are quite some arguments to be made against that, for instance that:

1. Traditional values=E2=80=99 go against the mandate of the UN Human Rig=
hts
Council (UN HRC) to promote universal respect for the protection of
all human rights for all people, without distinction of any kind and
in a fair and equal manner.

2. There is no agreed definition of =E2=80=98traditional values=E2=80=99

3. None of the resolutions of Traditional Values brought before the UN
HRC acknowledge the abuse of =E2=80=98traditional values=E2=80=99 and pra=
ctices by
States to legitimize discrimination, silence dissent, and justify
human rights violations. While many cultural practices have a positive
role for implementing universal human rights protections, others are
harmful and incompatible with human rights protection

And elaboration of these and more arguments about this can be found
here:
http://www.article19.org/resources.php/resource/37236/en/human-rights-cou=
ncil:-states-must-reject-traditional-values

Could I propose that we add: internationally accepted, in front of
'Universal Declaration of Human Rights', so that it reads:

The Human Rights Protocol Consideration Proposed Research Group is
chartered to research whether standards and protocols can enable,
strengthen or threaten human rights, as defined in the internationally
accepted Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) [0],
specifically the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly.

Happy to discuss!

Best,

Niels

PS Perhaps we could elaborate this more in the ID ?

Hi dkg,

To ensure clarity I would suggest making this: 'specifically the right
to freedom of expression and the right to freedom of assembly'

So that it is clear that these are two distinct rights in the UDHR and
ICCPR.

>=20

I think we should first focus on freedom of expression and freedom of
assembly because [a] the guidelines of privacy are already really
elaborate in RFC6973 [2] to make some progress it would probably help
to limit ourselves to some rights.

But at the same I would agree that the guidelines for privacy
considerations are not rooted in a human rights understanding of
privacy. RFC 6973 explicitly states:

[quote]
The guidance provided in this document is generic and can be used to
inform the design of any protocol to be used anywhere in the world,
without reference to specific legal frameworks.
[/quote]

I think this RFC would benefit from adding a reference to the right to
privacy in the UDHR and ICCPR. Perhaps the outcome of this research
could be a suggestion of adding such language to this RFC.

So I am completely OK with: "specifically, but not limited to".

>=20

Perhaps we can make it even shorter:

	Since the Internet's objective of connectivity makes it
	an enabler of human rights, its architectural design overlaps
	with the human rights framework.

Agreed. Don't you think 'with a focus on' not give us enough space to
also elaborate on other rights where needed or necessary?

Background
The Human Rights Protocol Consideration Proposed Research Group is
chartered to research whether standards and protocols can enable,
strengthen or threaten human rights, as defined in the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) [0] and the International Covenant
on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) [1], specifically, but not
limited to the right to freedom of expression and the right to freedom
of assembly.

The research group takes as its starting point the problem statement
that decisive and human-rights-enabling characteristics of the
Internet might be degraded if they're not properly defined, described
and sufficiently taken into account in protocol development. Not
protecting these characteristics could result in (partial) loss of
functionality and connectivity.

As stated in RFC 1958, the Internet aims to be the global network of
networks that provides unfettered connectivity to all users at all
times and for any content. Open, secure and reliable connectivity is
essential for rights such as freedom of expression and freedom of
association. Since the Internet's objective of connectivity makes it
an enabler of human rights, its architectural design overlaps with the
human rights framework.

Concerns for freedom of expression and association were a strong part
of the world-view of the community involved in developing the first
Internet protocols. The Internet was designed with freedom and
openness of communications as core values. But as the scale and the
industrialization of the Internet has grown greatly, the influence of
such world-views started to compete with other values. This research
group aims to expose the relations between human rights and protocols
and to provide guidelines to inform future protocol development
and decision making where protocols impact the effective exercise of
the rights to freedom of expression or association.

Objective
This research has two major aims:
- - to expose the relation between protocols and human rights, with a
  focus on the rights to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly,
  and

- - to propose guidelines to protect the Internet as a rights-enabling
  environment in future protocol development, in a manner similar to
  the work done for Privacy Considerations in RFC 6973.

Outputs
The research group plans on using  a variety of research methods to
create different outputs including (but not limited to):

- - Internet drafts - (some of which may be put on IRSG RFC track)
These would concern tracking of the project, methodology, and would
define any possible protocol considerations.

- - Policy and academic papers
For in depth analysis and discussion on the relationship between human
rights and the Internet architecture and protocols.

- - Film and textual interviews with members of the community
To give an accessible insight into the variety of opinions on this
topic represented in the IETF.

- - Data analysis and visualization
To research and visualize the language used in current and historic
RFCs and mailinglist discussions to expose core architectural
principles, language and deliberations on human rights of those
affected by the network.

- - Raising awareness
Improving the awareness in both the human rights community and the
technical community on the importance of the technical workings of the
Internet and its impact on human rights.

Membership
Membership is open to any interested parties who intend to remain
current with the published documents and mailing list issues.

Thanks Adamantia,

So we would need text in here:

[quote]
This research has two major aims:
- - to expose the relation between protocols and human rights, with a
  focus on the rights to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly,
  and

- - to propose guidelines to protect the Internet as a rights-enabling
  environment in future protocol development, in a manner similar to
  the work done for Privacy Considerations in RFC 6973.
[/quote]

If I follow your suggestions it might look like this:

- - to propose guidelines to to inform future protocol development
  and decision making where protocols impact the effective exercise of
  human rights in a manner similar to the work done for Privacy
  Considerations in RFC 6973.

But then there might be the misunderstanding that human rights are
also a topic for RFC6973, which it is not. There reference to RFC6973
is I think quite crucial to mention here. Would you have any text
suggestions?

Best,

Niels

Dear all,

It came to my attention that it's likely that several members of this
research group (Avri, Joana, Corinne, Joe, me and possible dkg) will
be in Washington DC on June 10. It would be great if we could make use
of this opportunity to have a working session on June 9 or June 11 to
further the work on the ID, review the research and (automated)
analysis of RFCs and prepare for the meeting in Prague as well as some
general discussion, division of tasks and strategizing on the future
of the research.

Would any of you be up for this, and if so, what date preference would
you have?

Looking forward to hear from you.

Best,

Niels

Niels et al,

-- its architectural design overlaps with the human rights framework

you might wish to replace overlaps with converges

-- The Internet was designed with freedom and openness of communications as
core values.

perhaps, "freedom of information and openness of communications"

-- expose the relation ..

study | research | explore | solidify would read better, I think


- - to propose guidelines to protect the Internet as a rights-enabling
environment
in future protocol development, in a manner similar to the work done for
Privacy Considerations in RFC 6973.

I see now that there is a repetitiveness. I think that what is needed is
already mentioned in the para previously to the Objectives section where it
reads "This research group aims to expose the relations between human
rights and protocols and to provide guidelines to inform future protocol
development and decision making where protocols impact the effective
exercise of the rights to freedom of expression or association".
So, in the 2nd objective you could follow the wording in RFC 6973 and say
"to offer guidelines for developing considerations relating to the rights
to freedom of expression and association for inclusion in protocol
specifications, in a manner similar to the work done in RFC".
I don't see any cause for misunderstandings - but this is just me.

Thanks,
Adamantia

Thanks for this. I think this is a bit too long, especially for the<br>
charter. I also have some specific comments inline:<br>

<br>
I wouldn&#39;t use about &#39;the authors&#39;, but rather &#39;the researc=
h group&#39;<br>
<br>
Furthermore I think we&#39;re confusing &#39;universal&#39; and &#39;absolu=
te&#39;.<br>
Historically human rights are exactly the instrument invented to<br>
counter absolutism, human rights are there to limit the power of<br>
states and to defend the rights of individuals.<br>
<br>
The concept of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is that these<br>
rights are universal. And since the overwhelming majority of countries<br>
is a member of the main human rights treaties, I think it is not hard<br>
to defend the universality of these principals.<br>
<br>
&gt; In full recognition of the fact that the debate on these values<br>
&gt; continues, that their interpretation is context dependent and often<br=
>
&gt; contentious,<br>
<br>
My main problem is that this paragraph implies that human rights are<br>
more contentious than they in fact are in terms of national and<br>
international law. This is not only a matter of states, it is an<br>
obligation of every state to uphold human rights, but all human beings<br>
and entities should respect human rights (hence the UN Guiding<br>
Principles on Business to Respect Human Rights).<br>
<br>
&gt; the group holds that, at this point in time, they are an<br>
&gt; appropriate departure point as they are the most complete<br>
&gt; overarching human rights framework and most legitimate set of<br>
&gt; globally shared human rights principles.<br>
&gt;<br>
<br>
The largest criticism of specific member states is that there are<br>
traditional values that might not be in line with human rights. There<br>
are quite some arguments to be made against that, for instance that:<br>
<br>
1. Traditional values=E2=80=99 go against the mandate of the UN Human Right=
s<br>
Council (UN HRC) to promote universal respect for the protection of<br>
all human rights for all people, without distinction of any kind and<br>
in a fair and equal manner.<br>
<br>
2. There is no agreed definition of =E2=80=98traditional values=E2=80=99<br=
>
<br>
3. None of the resolutions of Traditional Values brought before the UN<br>
HRC acknowledge the abuse of =E2=80=98traditional values=E2=80=99 and pract=
ices by<br>
States to legitimize discrimination, silence dissent, and justify<br>
human rights violations. While many cultural practices have a positive<br>
role for implementing universal human rights protections, others are<br>
harmful and incompatible with human rights protection<br>
<br>
And elaboration of these and more arguments about this can be found<br>
here:<br>

<br>
Could I propose that we add: internationally accepted, in front of<br>
&#39;Universal Declaration of Human Rights&#39;, so that it reads:<br>
<br>
The Human Rights Protocol Consideration Proposed Research Group is<br>
chartered to research whether standards and protocols can enable,<br>
strengthen or threaten human rights, as defined in the internationally<br>
accepted Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) [0],<br>
specifically the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly.<br=

<br>
Happy to discuss!<br>
<br>
Best,<br>
<br>

PS Perhaps we could elaborate this more in the ID ?<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; decisive and human-rights-enabling characteristics<br>

<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Open, secure and reliable connectivity is essential for rights<br>
&gt;&gt; such as freedom of expression and freedom of association, as<br>
&gt;&gt; defined in the UDHR.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; why mention UDHR again here?=C2=A0 can we just drop &quot;as defined i=
n the<br>
&gt; UDHR&quot;?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Therefore, considering connectivity as the ultimate objective of<b=
r>
&gt;&gt; the network, the Internet is not only an enabler of human rights,<=
br>
&gt;&gt; but that there is a strong overlap between the architecture of<br>
&gt;&gt; the network and human rights.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; This whole sentence is a bit awkward: the parallels aren&#39;t quite<b=
r>
&gt; parallel, and it tries to connecti things together that don&#39;t<br>
&gt; quite match up aesthetically.=C2=A0 how about:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Since the Internet&#39;s objective of connectivity makes it an enabler=
<br>
&gt; of human rights, its architectural design overlaps with the<br>
&gt; frameworks we use to define and discuss human rights.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Concerns for freedom of expression and association were a strong<b=
r>
&gt;&gt; part of the world-view of the community involved in developing<br>
&gt;&gt; the first Internet protocols. The Internet was designed with<br>
&gt;&gt; freedom and openness of communications as core values. But as the<=
br>
&gt;&gt; scale and the industrialization of the Internet has grown<br>
&gt;&gt; greatly, the influence of such world-views started to compete<br>
&gt;&gt; with other values. This research group aims to expose the<br>
&gt;&gt; relations between human rights and protocols and provide<br>
&gt;&gt; guidelines<br>
&gt;<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; how about &quot;to inform future protocol development and decision<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; This research aims to expose the relation between protocols and<br=

&gt;&gt; human rights, specifically the right to freedom of expression and<=
br>
&gt;&gt; freedom of assembly and propose guidelines to protect the<br>
&gt;&gt; Internet as rights enabling environment in future protocol<br>
&gt;&gt; development in a manner similar to the work done for RFC 6973 on<b=
r>
&gt;&gt; Privacy Consideration Guidelines,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; this kind of trailed off here -- is that last comma intended to be<br>
&gt; a period?=C2=A0 And again, we&#39;re limiting ourselves to just the<br=

&gt; expression and assembly, though i think other factors may be<br>
&gt; relevant too.=C2=A0 The constructions here are a little awkward too.<b=
r>
&gt; Maybe we could break this out into two bullets to make the section<br>
&gt; clearer?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; This research has two major aims:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; - to expose the relation between protocols and human rights, with<br>
&gt; a focus on the rights to freedom of expression and freedom of<br>
&gt; assembly, and<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; - to propose guidelines to protect the Internet as a<br>
&gt; rights-enabling environment in future protocol development, in a<br>
&gt; manner similar to the work done for Privacy Considerations in RFC<br>
&gt; 6973<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; - Film and paper based on interviews with members of the<br>
&gt;&gt; community To give an accessible insight into the variety of<br>

To ensure clarity I would suggest making this: &#39;specifically the right<=

<br>
So that it is clear that these are two distinct rights in the UDHR and<br>
ICCPR.<br>

&gt; moves more online, like taking part in government (article 21 of<br>
&gt; UDHR) in this age of twitter-moderated public service? Maybe we<br>
&gt; could say &quot;specifically, but not limited to&quot; ?<br>
&gt;<br>
<br>
I think we should first focus on freedom of expression and freedom of<br>
assembly because [a] the guidelines of privacy are already really<br>
elaborate in RFC6973 [2] to make some progress it would probably help<br>
to limit ourselves to some rights.<br>
<br>
But at the same I would agree that the guidelines for privacy<br>
considerations are not rooted in a human rights understanding of<br>
privacy. RFC 6973 explicitly states:<br>
<br>
[quote]<br>
The guidance provided in this document is generic and can be used to<br>
inform the design of any protocol to be used anywhere in the world,<br>
without reference to specific legal frameworks.<br>
[/quote]<br>
<br>
I think this RFC would benefit from adding a reference to the right to<br>
privacy in the UDHR and ICCPR. Perhaps the outcome of this research<br>
could be a suggestion of adding such language to this RFC.<br>
<br>
So I am completely OK with: &quot;specifically, but not limited to&quot;.<b=
r>
<br>
&gt;&gt; The research group takes as its starting point the problem<br>
&gt;&gt; statement that decisive and human rights enabling characteristics<=

&gt; I feel like this compound modifier needs some hyphenation, but i&#39;m=
<br>
&gt; not sure what the right thing to do is.=C2=A0 maybe:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; decisive and human-rights-enabling characteristics<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; ??<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I know it&#39;s not much of a style guide, but:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; <a href=3D"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#Compound_modifiers" ta=

<br>
&gt;<br>
<br>
Following your suggestion, adding this to the draft.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Open, secure and reliable connectivity is essential for rights<br>
&gt;&gt; such as freedom of expression and freedom of association, as<br>
&gt;&gt; defined in the UDHR.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; why mention UDHR again here?=C2=A0 can we just drop &quot;as defined i=
n the<br>
&gt; UDHR&quot;?<br>
&gt;<br>
<br>
Agreed.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Therefore, considering connectivity as the ultimate objective of<b=
r>
&gt;&gt; the network, the Internet is not only an enabler of human rights,<=
br>
&gt;&gt; but that there is a strong overlap between the architecture of<br>
&gt;&gt; the network and human rights.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; This whole sentence is a bit awkward: the parallels aren&#39;t quite<b=
r>
&gt; parallel, and it tries to connecti things together that don&#39;t<br>
&gt; quite match up aesthetically.=C2=A0 how about:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Since the Internet&#39;s objective of connectivity makes it an enabler=
<br>
&gt; of human rights, its architectural design overlaps with the<br>
&gt; frameworks we use to define and discuss human rights.<br>
&gt;<br>
<br>
Perhaps we can make it even shorter:<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 Since the Internet&#39;s objective of connectiv=
ity makes it<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 an enabler of human rights, its architectural d=
esign overlaps<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 with the human rights framework.<br>
<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Concerns for freedom of expression and association were a strong<b=
r>
&gt;&gt; part of the world-view of the community involved in developing<br>
&gt;&gt; the first Internet protocols. The Internet was designed with<br>
&gt;&gt; freedom and openness of communications as core values. But as the<=
br>
&gt;&gt; scale and the industrialization of the Internet has grown<br>
&gt;&gt; greatly, the influence of such world-views started to compete<br>
&gt;&gt; with other values. This research group aims to expose the<br>
&gt;&gt; relations between human rights and protocols and provide<br>
&gt;&gt; guidelines<br>

Integration of the comments made by dkg<br>
<br>
<br>
Background<br>
The Human Rights Protocol Consideration Proposed Research Group is<br>
chartered to research whether standards and protocols can enable,<br>
strengthen or threaten human rights, as defined in the Universal<br>
Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) [0] and the International Covenant<br>
on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) [1], specifically, but not<br>
limited to the right to freedom of expression and the right to freedom<br>
of assembly.<br>
<br>
The research group takes as its starting point the problem statement<br>
that decisive and human-rights-enabling characteristics of the<br>
Internet might be degraded if they&#39;re not properly defined, described<b=
r>
and sufficiently taken into account in protocol development. Not<br>
protecting these characteristics could result in (partial) loss of<br>
functionality and connectivity.<br>
<br>
As stated in RFC 1958, the Internet aims to be the global network of<br>
networks that provides unfettered connectivity to all users at all<br>
times and for any content. Open, secure and reliable connectivity is<br>
essential for rights such as freedom of expression and freedom of<br>
association. Since the Internet&#39;s objective of connectivity makes it<br=
>
an enabler of human rights, its architectural design overlaps with the<br>
human rights framework.<br>
<br>
Concerns for freedom of expression and association were a strong part<br>
of the world-view of the community involved in developing the first<br>
Internet protocols. The Internet was designed with freedom and<br>
openness of communications as core values. But as the scale and the<br>
industrialization of the Internet has grown greatly, the influence of<br>
such world-views started to compete with other values. This research<br>
group aims to expose the relations between human rights and protocols<br>
and to provide guidelines to inform future protocol development<br>
and decision making where protocols impact the effective exercise of<br>
the rights to freedom of expression or association.<br>
<br>
Objective<br>
This research has two major aims:<br>
- - to expose the relation between protocols and human rights, with a<br>
=C2=A0 focus on the rights to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly=
,<br>
=C2=A0 and<br>
<br>
- - to propose guidelines to protect the Internet as a rights-enabling<br>
=C2=A0 environment in future protocol development, in a manner similar to<b=
r>
=C2=A0 the work done for Privacy Considerations in RFC 6973.<br>
<br>
Outputs<br>
The research group plans on using=C2=A0 a variety of research methods to<br=
>
create different outputs including (but not limited to):<br>
<br>
- - Internet drafts - (some of which may be put on IRSG RFC track)<br>
These would concern tracking of the project, methodology, and would<br>
define any possible protocol considerations.<br>
<br>
- - Policy and academic papers<br>
For in depth analysis and discussion on the relationship between human<br>
rights and the Internet architecture and protocols.<br>
<br>
- - Film and textual interviews with members of the community<br>
To give an accessible insight into the variety of opinions on this<br>
topic represented in the IETF.<br>
<br>
- - Data analysis and visualization<br>
To research and visualize the language used in current and historic<br>
RFCs and mailinglist discussions to expose core architectural<br>
principles, language and deliberations on human rights of those<br>
affected by the network.<br>
<br>
- - Raising awareness<br>
Improving the awareness in both the human rights community and the<br>
technical community on the importance of the technical workings of the<br>
Internet and its impact on human rights.<br>

I like it. Will add.

Not sure whether access to information was one of the first aims. It
seems that communications and connectivity was traditionally more
important, according to RFC1958.

When a relation is studied, researched or explored, there is not
really a clear output (except for the study / research itself).
When a relation is exposed it really shows the relation and would work
better as an objective imho, because it shows want you want to
achieve, not what you want to do.

Not sure whether solidify is the right word here, because the relation
could be both positive and negative vis a vis human rights.

I'd prefer expose, but happy to discuss.

>=20

If I look at the three options:

[current draft text]
- - to propose guidelines to protect the Internet as a human-rights-
  enabling environment in future protocol development, in a manner
  similar to the work done for Privacy Considerations in RFC 6973.

[proposed by me in previous email]
- - to propose guidelines to inform future protocol development
  and decision making where protocols impact the effective exercise of
  human rights in a manner similar to the work done for Privacy
  Considerations in RFC 6973.

[proposed by Adamantia]
- - to offer guidelines for developing considerations relating to the
  rights to freedom of expression and association for inclusion in
  protocol specifications, in a manner similar to the work done in RFC
  6973

I still think the first (and current text) is the most clear, and the
second is a bit of a repetition of the sentence in the previous
paragraph. The third sounds quite 'indirect' for an objective imho.

For me the objective of this RG is to contribute to the protection of
the Internet as a human-rights-enabling environment, the way to do
that (outcome/output) would be to propose guidelines (as done in RFC
6973), as is mentioned as well in the first output.

Again, happy to discuss this further. Also curious to hear what other
people think about this.

Best,

Niels

Background
The Human Rights Protocol Consideration Proposed Research Group is
chartered to research whether standards and protocols can enable,
strengthen or threaten human rights, as defined in the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) [0] and the International Covenant
on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) [1], specifically, but not
limited to the right to freedom of expression and the right to freedom
of assembly.

The research group takes as its starting point the problem statement
that decisive and human-rights-enabling characteristics of the
Internet might be degraded if they're not properly defined, described
and sufficiently taken into account in protocol development. Not
protecting these characteristics could result in (partial) loss of
functionality and connectivity.

As stated in RFC 1958, the Internet aims to be the global network of
networks that provides unfettered connectivity to all users at all
times and for any content. Open, secure and reliable connectivity is
essential for rights such as freedom of expression and freedom of
association. Since the Internet's objective of connectivity makes it
an enabler of human rights, its architectural design converges with the
human rights framework.

Concerns for freedom of expression and association were a strong part
of the world-view of the community involved in developing the first
Internet protocols. The Internet was designed with freedom and
openness of communications as core values. But as the scale and the
industrialization of the Internet has grown greatly, the influence of
such world-views started to compete with other values. This research
group aims to expose the relations between human rights and protocols
and to provide guidelines to inform future protocol development
and decision making where protocols impact the effective exercise of
the rights to freedom of expression or association.

Objective
This research has two major aims:
- to expose the relation between protocols and human rights, with a
  focus on the rights to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly,
  and

- to propose guidelines to protect the Internet as a human-rights-
  enabling environment in future protocol development, in a manner
  similar to the work done for Privacy Considerations in RFC 6973.

Outputs
The research group plans on using  a variety of research methods to
create different outputs including (but not limited to):

- Internet drafts - (some of which may be put on IRSG RFC track)
These would concern tracking of the project, methodology, and would
define any possible protocol considerations.

- Policy and academic papers
For in depth analysis and discussion on the relationship between human
rights and the Internet architecture and protocols.

- Film and textual interviews with members of the community
To give an accessible insight into the variety of opinions on this
topic represented in the IETF.

- Data analysis and visualization
To research and visualize the language used in current and historic
RFCs and mailinglist discussions to expose core architectural
principles, language and deliberations on human rights of those
affected by the network.

- Raising awareness
Improving the awareness in both the human rights community and the
technical community on the importance of the technical workings of the
Internet and its impact on human rights.

Membership
Membership is open to any interested parties who intend to remain
current with the published documents and mailing list issues.

11:30 - 11:45 Preferences and priorities
11:45 - 12:30 Sprint 1
12:30 - 13:15 Lunch

Heya! Glad to see this happening... I'm likely unable to attend the
entire day, but I'll come for what I can. (More than happy to talk
about CDT's work.)

Hi,

Unless there is strong sentiment against doing so from any of the
participants on this list, I would like to recommend sending this draft
on to Lars and the IRSG for review and consideration.

Thanks for all the comments and serious discussions on this.  As one of
the team that came up with the idea for this research, I am very
appreciative of the attention it is being given.

I believe that now we need to get back to giving the research itself
this kind of detailed attention.  I am looking forward to seeing
substantive contributions from some of you who have shown such insight
in the crafting of the draft charter.

Thanks

avri

I think it's looking very good. The one quibble I have that remains is with
this statement:

"The research group takes as its starting point the problem statement
that decisive and human-rights-enabling characteristics of the
Internet might be degraded if they're not properly defined, described
and sufficiently taken into account in protocol development."

I think that's a bit strong given that there isn't positive evidence that
conscious incorporation of human rights values during protocol design
results in better rights-enabling infrastructure. I'd prefer something like:

"The research group takes as its starting point the problem statement
that decisive and human-rights-enabling characteristics of the
Internet are best supported by properly defining and describing
these characteristics so that they can be sufficiently taken into account
in protocol development."

I still don't like the word "decisive" here as I don't think that means
anything in the communities I'm familiar with (IETF for example) and is
this the "Human Rights and Decisive Characteristics Protocol
Considerations" group? I'd suggest dropping decisive throughout the charter
or being more explicit in the charter that there are things that are not
human rights (or you could have a scope paragraph that explained what human
rights and other concepts are in scope, and that the group is initially
starting with a focus on a subset).

best, Joe

&gt;<br>
&gt; Background<br>
&gt; The Human Rights Protocol Consideration Proposed Research Group is<br>
&gt; chartered to research whether standards and protocols can enable,<br>
&gt; strengthen or threaten human rights, as defined in the Universal<br>
&gt; Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) [0] and the International Covenant<=
br>
&gt; on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) [1], specifically, but not<br>
&gt; limited to the right to freedom of expression and the right to freedom=
<br>
&gt; of assembly.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; The research group takes as its starting point the problem statement<b=
r>
&gt; that decisive and human-rights-enabling characteristics of the<br>
&gt; Internet might be degraded if they&#39;re not properly defined, descri=
bed<br>
&gt; and sufficiently taken into account in protocol development. Not<br>
&gt; protecting these characteristics could result in (partial) loss of<br>
&gt; functionality and connectivity.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; As stated in RFC 1958, the Internet aims to be the global network of<b=
r>
&gt; networks that provides unfettered connectivity to all users at all<br>
&gt; times and for any content. Open, secure and reliable connectivity is<b=
r>
&gt; essential for rights such as freedom of expression and freedom of<br>
&gt; association. Since the Internet&#39;s objective of connectivity makes =
it<br>
&gt; an enabler of human rights, its architectural design converges with th=
e<br>
&gt; human rights framework.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Concerns for freedom of expression and association were a strong part<=
br>
&gt; of the world-view of the community involved in developing the first<br=

&gt; openness of communications as core values. But as the scale and the<br=

&gt; such world-views started to compete with other values. This research<b=

&gt; and to provide guidelines to inform future protocol development<br>
&gt; and decision making where protocols impact the effective exercise of<b=

Am not sure why you think this is strong. The essence of a problem
statement is that it describes a problem which needs to be addressed
by the research group. The objective of this group would be to provide
the lacking evidence that you describe (as is described in the first
objective).

I think this point is fair. Am OK with dropping 'decisive' here, as
far as I see this is also the only place where it's mentioned.

Ok, I guess that wasn't clear to me from the text. I'm fine with the
text here now having seen this explanation.

Thanks, I'm for shipping it.

Removed 'decisive and' cf. the discussion/consensus with Joe.

Background
The Human Rights Protocol Consideration Proposed Research Group is
chartered to research whether standards and protocols can enable,
strengthen or threaten human rights, as defined in the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) [0] and the International Covenant
on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) [1], specifically, but not
limited to the right to freedom of expression and the right to freedom
of assembly.

The research group takes as its starting point the problem statement
that human-rights-enabling characteristics of the Internet might be
degraded if they're not properly defined, described and sufficiently
taken into account in protocol development. Not protecting these
characteristics could result in (partial) loss of functionality and
connectivity.

As stated in RFC 1958, the Internet aims to be the global network of
networks that provides unfettered connectivity to all users at all
times and for any content. Open, secure and reliable connectivity is
essential for rights such as freedom of expression and freedom of
association. Since the Internet's objective of connectivity makes it
an enabler of human rights, its architectural design converges with the
human rights framework.

Concerns for freedom of expression and association were a strong part
of the world-view of the community involved in developing the first
Internet protocols. The Internet was designed with freedom and
openness of communications as core values. But as the scale and the
industrialization of the Internet has grown greatly, the influence of
such world-views started to compete with other values. This research
group aims to expose the relations between human rights and protocols
and to provide guidelines to inform future protocol development
and decision making where protocols impact the effective exercise of
the rights to freedom of expression or association.

Objective
This research has two major aims:
- - to expose the relation between protocols and human rights, with a
  focus on the rights to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly,
  and

- - to propose guidelines to protect the Internet as a human-rights-
  enabling environment in future protocol development, in a manner
  similar to the work done for Privacy Considerations in RFC 6973.

Outputs
The research group plans on using  a variety of research methods to
create different outputs including (but not limited to):

- - Internet drafts - (some of which may be put on IRSG RFC track)
These would concern tracking of the project, methodology, and would
define any possible protocol considerations.

- - Policy and academic papers
For in depth analysis and discussion on the relationship between human
rights and the Internet architecture and protocols.

- - Film and textual interviews with members of the community
To give an accessible insight into the variety of opinions on this
topic represented in the IETF.

- - Data analysis and visualization
To research and visualize the language used in current and historic
RFCs and mailinglist discussions to expose core architectural
principles, language and deliberations on human rights of those
affected by the network.

- - Raising awareness
Improving the awareness in both the human rights community and the
technical community on the importance of the technical workings of the
Internet and its impact on human rights.

Membership
Membership is open to any interested parties who intend to remain
current with the published documents and mailing list issues.

Hi,

thanks Joseph and Neils.

Any other issues?

I suggest giving it the rest of this week and then sending the revised
proposed charter on Monday, if there are no other issues.

Hey HRPCers--

Just wanted to draw your attention to this report from David Kaye, the
UN's special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to
freedom of opinion and expression:

  http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/RegularSessions/Session29/Documents/A.HRC.29.32_AEV.doc

It looks like a pretty sound endorsement of encryption and anonymity
tools, and pretty strong pushback against backdoors and weakened
standards (i confess i've only skimmed it thus far, please point out if
i've missed something).

The Washington Post wrote it up here:

  http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2015/05/28/un-report-encryption-is-important-to-human-rights-and-backdoors-undermine-it/

All the best,

    --dkg

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

Dear all,

With great pleasure I can conclude we have reached consensus on a
charter for this proposed research group. Please find the final version
underneath. I will also forward this to Lars.

Great work all. Looking forward now to work with all of you on the new
version of the ID , I am also greatly looking forwards to the interim
meeting that we will hold on the 9th of June in DC.

Best,

Niels



Background
The Human Rights Protocol Consideration Proposed Research Group is
chartered to research whether standards and protocols can enable,
strengthen or threaten human rights, as defined in the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) [0] and the International Covenant
on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) [1], specifically, but not
limited to the right to freedom of expression and the right to freedom
of assembly.

The research group takes as its starting point the problem statement
that human-rights-enabling characteristics of the Internet might be
degraded if they're not properly defined, described and sufficiently
taken into account in protocol development. Not protecting these
characteristics could result in (partial) loss of functionality and
connectivity.

As stated in RFC 1958, the Internet aims to be the global network of
networks that provides unfettered connectivity to all users at all
times and for any content. Open, secure and reliable connectivity is
essential for rights such as freedom of expression and freedom of
association. Since the Internet's objective of connectivity makes it
an enabler of human rights, its architectural design converges with the
human rights framework.

Concerns for freedom of expression and association were a strong part
of the world-view of the community involved in developing the first
Internet protocols. The Internet was designed with freedom and
openness of communications as core values. But as the scale and the
industrialization of the Internet has grown greatly, the influence of
such world-views started to compete with other values. This research
group aims to expose the relations between human rights and protocols
and to provide guidelines to inform future protocol development
and decision making where protocols impact the effective exercise of
the rights to freedom of expression or association.

Objective
This research has two major aims:
- - to expose the relation between protocols and human rights, with a
focus on the rights to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly,
and

- - to propose guidelines to protect the Internet as a human-rights-
enabling environment in future protocol development, in a manner
similar to the work done for Privacy Considerations in RFC 6973.

Outputs
The research group plans on using a variety of research methods to
create different outputs including (but not limited to):

- - Internet drafts - (some of which may be put on IRSG RFC track)
These would concern tracking of the project, methodology, and would
define any possible protocol considerations.

- - Policy and academic papers
For in depth analysis and discussion on the relationship between human

Hi,

I've received the charter; thanks.

Let me level-set expectations here: I won't formally charter anything for a=
 while yet, but that should not stop you from starting to work. Quite the o=
pposite: The reason for waiting with a formal charter action is that we've =
seen too many new RGs die on the starting line from lack of participation a=
nd energy. So start building your community, and start working on the topic=
s that you want to work on, and if all goes well the formal chartering deci=
sion will be an obvious one.
