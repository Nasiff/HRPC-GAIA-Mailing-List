Dear all,

Based on the traffic on this list, some interviews and discussions I
drafted new text for the ID. The additions are to 2. research topic
and 3. Proposal. I pasted the proposed text underneath, happy to discuss.

The deadline for sending in the ID is the 9th, and since we will also
need to consolidate the comments and put the ID in XML it would be
greatly appreciated if you could comment in the coming days (before
the 7th) so we can still integrate your comments in the ID, but of
course also happy to discuss afterwards and in Dallas.

Looking forward to your comments, questions and suggestions.

Best,

Niels

PS The original ID can be found here:
https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-doria-hrpc-proposal-00

2.  Research topic
In a manner similar to the work done for RFC 6973 [RFC6973] on Privacy
Consideration Guidelines, the premise of this research is that some
standards and protocols can solidify, enable or threaten human rights,
such as freedom of expression and the right to association and
assembly online.

RFC 6973 however asserts privacy as a subset of security, and security
aims to solely serve growth of the network and communication:

Development of security mechanisms is seen as a key factor in the
future growth of the Internet as a motor for international commerce
and communication.[RFC1984]  and according to the Danvers Doctrine,
there  is an overwhelming  consensus in the IETF that the best
security  should be used and  standardized.[RFC3365]. At the same time:

The  Internet Architecture Board (IAB) and the Internet Engineering
Steering  Group (IESG), the bodies which oversee architecture and
standards for  the Internet, are concerned by the need for increased
protection of  international commercial transactions on the Internet,
and by the need  to offer all Internet users an adequate degree of
privacy. [RFC1984]

This  shows that security and privacy are very high on the agenda of
the  IETF, but a reason for this, outside of underpinning growth and
trust of  the network, is not given. In this research it is argued
that security and privacy are (contributing to) essential human
rights; such as freedom of expression, the right to information, the
right to  privacy, and the right to security.

The Internet aims to be a global network of network that provides
connectivity to all its users, just like the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights provides rights to all citizens. This makes a clear case
that the Internet is not only an enabler of human rights, but that
human rights, lie at the basis of, and is ingrained in, the network.
Furthermore  interview will be done with  the chair of the Internet
Architecture  Board (IAB), members of the  Internet Engineering
Steering Group (IESG)  and chairs of selected  working groups and RFC
authors.

To start addressing the issue, a mapping exercise analyzing Internet
architecture and protocols features, vis-a-vis possible impact on
human rights needs to be
undertaken.

[snip, leaving the examples in place]

3.  Proposal
Mapping the relation between human rights and protocols and
architectures is a new research challenge, which will require a good
amount of cross organizational cooperation to develop a consistent
methodology.  While the authors of this first draft are involved in
both human rights advocacy and research on Internet technologies - we
believe that bringing this work into the IRTF would facilitate and
improve this work by bringing human rights experts together with the
community of researchers and developers of Internet standards and
technologies.

At this point we have created a mailing list where we would like to
encourage discussion of the issue and capture interest of the IRTF
community.  A second step would be to create a charter and ask the
IRTF for a Research group to further develop methodology and
investigate Human rights Protocol considerations.

Assuming that the research produces useful results, the objective
would evolve into the creation of a set of recommended considerations
for the protection of applicable human rights.

In the  analysis of existing RFCs central design and technical
concepts have been found which impact human rights. These concepts
will form the lens for the analysis of RFCs and will be further
described vis a vis their impact on human rights.

The current working assumption is the following:

The  combination of content agnosticism, connectivity, security (as
defined in RFC 3365) [RFC3365] and privacy (as defined in RFC 6973)
[RFC6973] are the technical principles that underly freedom of
expression on the Internet.

Privacy and security are defined, so here we focus on concepts that
have not been defined as considerations that are relevant for freedom
of expression.

This is a non-exhaustive first list of concepts, which definitions
should be improved and further aligned with existing RFCs.

Connectivity
The Internet is the tool for providing global connectivity conform
RFC1958. Therefore all protocols and standards should aim to improve
connectivity, and not to limit it.

Distributed
To  enable and strengthen connectivity, stability, and sustainability
of  the network, protocols and standards should be developed in a way
that  they can be implemented in a distributed way, if not, strong
accountability mechanism should be in place.

Inter-operable
Standards exist to design systems that allow for other systems to
interact freely and openly.

Reliable
Reliability ensures that a protocol will execute its function
consistently and  error resistant as described and function without
unexpected result, also when there is an increase or decrease of
throughput. A system that is reliable will have a documented way to
recover from failure.

Scalable
Any  solution should support growth of the network with more hosts,
users and traffic. And have clear understanding of it's scope and
ideally a proposition how it can be expanded in order to support
greater capacity.

Stateless / state-full
If  possible protocols should be implemented stateless for reliability
and privacy considerations. If not, they should keep as little state
as possible.

Content agnostic
Protocols should not treat packets/datagrams differently based on
their content.

Transparent
Protocols should be transparent in what they can do and can not do and
how it is  done. Implementation of protocols should advertise it's
policies on data retention for the service and which jurisdiction it
falls under.

Debugging
A protocol should allow a user to troubleshoot and debug possible
causes of malfunction and loss of reliability.

Robust, robustness
Protocols should be resistant to errors, involuntary legal or
malicious attempts  to disrupt its mode of operations. Protocols
should be developed in a  way that there is no (intransparent) kill
switch. There should also be a clear description on how a protocol
recovers from potential failures.

End user-centric / representing  stakeholder rights
As proposed in draft-nottingham-stakeholder-rights-00:

[QUOTE]
Protocols MUST document relevant primary stakeholders and their
interrelationships.

[..]

 End-user-facing application protocols MUST prioritise their users
higher than any other stakeholders.
Extensions to existing protocols MUST document how they interact with
the extended protocol's stakeholders.  If the extended protocol's
stakeholders are not yet documented, the extension MAY estimate its
impact, in coordination with that protocol's community and the IESG.
The burden of this documentation need not be high; if HTML can do it
in a paragraph, so can most protocols.  While it might be appropriate
in a separate document (e.g., a requirements or use cases draft) or
the protocol specification itself, documenting stakeholders in the WG
charter has considerable benefits, since it clarifies their
relationships up-front.

Hiya,

I'm at a UNESCO conference at the moment [1] and they have a
draft document for which they'd like to get more technical
review. [2]

I'm not sure to which email address they'd like comments sent
but I'll check tomorrow and send a mail here. You'll not have
read the 96 pages by then most likely though:-) But it's pretty
relevant to this list I think.

Cheers,
S.

Dear all,

Just a thought:

It's clear that there are privacy considerations w/ standards, and security
issues, of course, and those are both human rights issues even though  IT
privacy and security are not usually framed within a human rights context.
However, should we be even more specific in this document of what makes
standards development different from any other Internet/IT engineering
issues?

Users interface with software and hardware more than they do with
networking or encryption standards. Why are protocols / standards unique?
Or perhaps more relevant, how do we justify our particular focus on them.
It's a small thing - but I think it might make the document a little
stronger still if we address this issue, because I feel this might be a
point of critique brought up at the upcoming meeting.

On that same note - I recently booked my flight to Dallas and look forward
to meeting everyone who will also be attending.

Best,

Corinne

Dear all,<br>
<br>
Based on the traffic on this list, some interviews and discussions I<br>
drafted new text for the ID. The additions are to 2. research topic<br>
and 3. Proposal. I pasted the proposed text underneath, happy to discuss.<b=

<br>
The deadline for sending in the ID is the 9th, and since we will also<br>
need to consolidate the comments and put the ID in XML it would be<br>
greatly appreciated if you could comment in the coming days (before<br>
the 7th) so we can still integrate your comments in the ID, but of<br>
course also happy to discuss afterwards and in Dallas.<br>
<br>
Looking forward to your comments, questions and suggestions.<br>

<br>
2.=C2=A0 Research topic<br>
In a manner similar to the work done for RFC 6973 [RFC6973] on Privacy<br>
Consideration Guidelines, the premise of this research is that some<br>
standards and protocols can solidify, enable or threaten human rights,<br>
such as freedom of expression and the right to association and<br>
assembly online.<br>
<br>
RFC 6973 however asserts privacy as a subset of security, and security<br>
aims to solely serve growth of the network and communication:<br>
<br>
Development of security mechanisms is seen as a key factor in the<br>
future growth of the Internet as a motor for international commerce<br>
and communication.[RFC1984]=C2=A0 and according to the Danvers Doctrine,<br=
>
there=C2=A0 is an overwhelming=C2=A0 consensus in the IETF that the best<br=
>
security=C2=A0 should be used and=C2=A0 standardized.[RFC3365]. At the same=
 time:<br>
<br>
The=C2=A0 Internet Architecture Board (IAB) and the Internet Engineering<br=
>
Steering=C2=A0 Group (IESG), the bodies which oversee architecture and<br>
standards for=C2=A0 the Internet, are concerned by the need for increased<b=
r>
protection of=C2=A0 international commercial transactions on the Internet,<=
br>
and by the need=C2=A0 to offer all Internet users an adequate degree of<br>
privacy. [RFC1984]<br>
<br>
This=C2=A0 shows that security and privacy are very high on the agenda of<b=
r>
the=C2=A0 IETF, but a reason for this, outside of underpinning growth and<b=
r>
trust of=C2=A0 the network, is not given. In this research it is argued<br>
that security and privacy are (contributing to) essential human<br>
rights; such as freedom of expression, the right to information, the<br>
right to=C2=A0 privacy, and the right to security.<br>
<br>
The Internet aims to be a global network of network that provides<br>
connectivity to all its users, just like the Universal Declaration of<br>
Human Rights provides rights to all citizens. This makes a clear case<br>
that the Internet is not only an enabler of human rights, but that<br>
human rights, lie at the basis of, and is ingrained in, the network.<br>
Furthermore=C2=A0 interview will be done with=C2=A0 the chair of the Intern=
et<br>
Architecture=C2=A0 Board (IAB), members of the=C2=A0 Internet Engineering<b=
r>
Steering Group (IESG)=C2=A0 and chairs of selected=C2=A0 working groups and=
 RFC<br>
authors.<br>
<br>
To start addressing the issue, a mapping exercise analyzing Internet<br>
architecture and protocols features, vis-a-vis possible impact on<br>
human rights needs to be<br>
undertaken.<br>
<br>
[snip, leaving the examples in place]<br>
<br>
3.=C2=A0 Proposal<br>
Mapping the relation between human rights and protocols and<br>
architectures is a new research challenge, which will require a good<br>
amount of cross organizational cooperation to develop a consistent<br>
methodology.=C2=A0 While the authors of this first draft are involved in<br=
>
both human rights advocacy and research on Internet technologies - we<br>
believe that bringing this work into the IRTF would facilitate and<br>
improve this work by bringing human rights experts together with the<br>
community of researchers and developers of Internet standards and<br>
technologies.<br>
<br>
At this point we have created a mailing list where we would like to<br>
encourage discussion of the issue and capture interest of the IRTF<br>
community.=C2=A0 A second step would be to create a charter and ask the<br>
IRTF for a Research group to further develop methodology and<br>
investigate Human rights Protocol considerations.<br>
<br>
Assuming that the research produces useful results, the objective<br>
would evolve into the creation of a set of recommended considerations<br>
for the protection of applicable human rights.<br>
<br>
In the=C2=A0 analysis of existing RFCs central design and technical<br>
concepts have been found which impact human rights. These concepts<br>
will form the lens for the analysis of RFCs and will be further<br>
described vis a vis their impact on human rights.<br>
<br>
The current working assumption is the following:<br>
<br>
The=C2=A0 combination of content agnosticism, connectivity, security (as<br=
>
defined in RFC 3365) [RFC3365] and privacy (as defined in RFC 6973)<br>
[RFC6973] are the technical principles that underly freedom of<br>
expression on the Internet.<br>
<br>
Privacy and security are defined, so here we focus on concepts that<br>
have not been defined as considerations that are relevant for freedom<br>
of expression.<br>
<br>
This is a non-exhaustive first list of concepts, which definitions<br>
should be improved and further aligned with existing RFCs.<br>
<br>
Connectivity<br>
The Internet is the tool for providing global connectivity conform<br>
RFC1958. Therefore all protocols and standards should aim to improve<br>
connectivity, and not to limit it.<br>
<br>
Distributed<br>
To=C2=A0 enable and strengthen connectivity, stability, and sustainability<=
br>
of=C2=A0 the network, protocols and standards should be developed in a way<=
br>
that=C2=A0 they can be implemented in a distributed way, if not, strong<br>
accountability mechanism should be in place.<br>
<br>
Inter-operable<br>
Standards exist to design systems that allow for other systems to<br>
interact freely and openly.<br>
<br>
Reliable<br>
Reliability ensures that a protocol will execute its function<br>
consistently and=C2=A0 error resistant as described and function without<br=
>
unexpected result, also when there is an increase or decrease of<br>
throughput. A system that is reliable will have a documented way to<br>
recover from failure.<br>
<br>
Scalable<br>
Any=C2=A0 solution should support growth of the network with more hosts,<br=
>
users and traffic. And have clear understanding of it&#39;s scope and<br>
ideally a proposition how it can be expanded in order to support<br>
greater capacity.<br>
<br>
Stateless / state-full<br>
If=C2=A0 possible protocols should be implemented stateless for reliability=
<br>
and privacy considerations. If not, they should keep as little state<br>
as possible.<br>
<br>
Content agnostic<br>
Protocols should not treat packets/datagrams differently based on<br>
their content.<br>
<br>
Transparent<br>
Protocols should be transparent in what they can do and can not do and<br>
how it is=C2=A0 done. Implementation of protocols should advertise it&#39;s=
<br>
policies on data retention for the service and which jurisdiction it<br>
falls under.<br>
<br>
Debugging<br>
A protocol should allow a user to troubleshoot and debug possible<br>
causes of malfunction and loss of reliability.<br>
<br>
Robust, robustness<br>
Protocols should be resistant to errors, involuntary legal or<br>
malicious attempts=C2=A0 to disrupt its mode of operations. Protocols<br>
should be developed in a=C2=A0 way that there is no (intransparent) kill<br=
>
switch. There should also be a clear description on how a protocol<br>
recovers from potential failures.<br>
<br>
End user-centric / representing=C2=A0 stakeholder rights<br>
As proposed in draft-nottingham-stakeholder-rights-00:<br>
<br>
[QUOTE]<br>
Protocols MUST document relevant primary stakeholders and their<br>
interrelationships.<br>
<br>
[..]<br>
<br>
=C2=A0End-user-facing application protocols MUST prioritise their users<br>

Extensions to existing protocols MUST document how they interact with<br>
the extended protocol&#39;s stakeholders.=C2=A0 If the extended protocol&#3=
9;s<br>
stakeholders are not yet documented, the extension MAY estimate its<br>
impact, in coordination with that protocol&#39;s community and the IESG.<br=

The burden of this documentation need not be high; if HTML can do it<br>
in a paragraph, so can most protocols.=C2=A0 While it might be appropriate<=

in a separate document (e.g., a requirements or use cases draft) or<br>

Hiya,<br>
<br>
I&#39;m at a UNESCO conference at the moment [1] and they have a<br>
draft document for which they&#39;d like to get more technical<br>
review. [2]<br>

I&#39;m not sure to which email address they&#39;d like comments sent<br>

Hi Corinne,

Not sure, what about the Human Rights Council resolution "on the
promotion, protection and enjoyment of human rights on the Internet",
the the resolution "The right to privacy in the digital age" by the UN
general assembly and the NETmundial outcome document?

Protocols are the standards for the exchange of information. So they
ensure that systems can communicate with each other, but also shape
the way in which that is done, what is possible, and what is not. That
is the unique and important role of standards in the ecosystem. In
other words: Protocols and standards form the basis of the the
Internet, they define what the Internet is and how it works. I think
that's why we're focusing on them,

Always happy to consider text proposals for the ID of course.

A new version of I-D, draft-doria-hrpc-proposal-01.txt
has been successfully submitted by Avri Doria and posted to the
IETF repository.

Name:		draft-doria-hrpc-proposal
Revision:	01
Title:		Proposal for research on human rights protocol considerations
Document date:	2015-03-09
Group:		Individual Submission
Pages:		13

Diff:
http://www.ietf.org/rfcdiff?url2=3Ddraft-doria-hrpc-proposal-01

Abstract:
   Work has been done on privacy issues that should be considered when
   creating an Internet protocol.  This draft suggests that similar
   considerations may apply for other human rights such as freedom of
   expression or freedom of association.  A proposal is made for work in
   the IRTF researching the possible connections between human rights
   and Internet standards and protocols.  The goal is to create an
   informational RFC concerning human rights protocol considerations.

   Discussion on this draft at: hrpc@article19.io





Please note that it may take a couple of minutes from the time of
submission
until the htmlized version and diff are available at tools.ietf.org.

      Abstract:<br>
       Work has been done on privacy issues that should be considered
      when<br>
       creating an Internet protocol. This draft suggests that
      similar<br>
       considerations may apply for other human rights such as freedom
      of<br>
       expression or freedom of association. A proposal is made for
      work in<br>
       the IRTF researching the possible connections between human
      rights<br>
       and Internet standards and protocols. The goal is to create an<br>
       informational RFC concerning human rights protocol
      considerations.<br>

Hi,

During the HRPC meeting at IETF92 there were a couple of proposal on how
to address human rights issues in protocol design. We clearly need some
sort of definition that is clear to protocol designers, implementers and
people that deploy these protocols in the real world.

I don't think that "protocol perversion" is an appropriate term; as some
have already pointed out, 'perversion' might be a positive protocol
feature that enables technology evolution.

  * Wrongly answering DNS queries (Turkey) is a technique that some
    CDNs also use to speed up answering requests or giving geolocation
    aware answers.

  * BGP Hijacking is correct use of the protocol as specified.

  * QoS techniques as used in Iran and China are used as specified.

  ..et cetera..


I think the proper approach is to think of intent (as done in security
in general). Speaking of malicious intent when a protocol is (mis)used
in a way that causes human rights issues would be an example.


Input appreciated.

Aaron

I find myself thinking about:

1) a grammatical construct using the words =E2=80=9Cyou=E2=80=9D, =
=E2=80=9Care=E2=80=9D, =E2=80=9Ca=E2=80=9D, =E2=80=9Cterrible=E2=80=9D, =
and =E2=80=9Cperson=E2=80=9D,

2) the sentence =E2=80=9Cyou are a terrible person=E2=80=9D, and

3) an instance of the use of that sentence, with an identified speaker =
and an identified subject of the word =E2=80=9Cyou=E2=80=9D.

Those are clearly three different things. This comes back to the =

protocol.

I=E2=80=99m concerned about the discussion confusing the three, and =
would appreciate them being kept separate.

Hello all (and a special welcome to new list members),

Thank you very much for working with us this week, whether it was by
participating in interviews, joining the session or sharing your views
and knowledge. We're slowly starting to process all the input, but to
keep the dialogue going we'll keep releasing our notes and thoughts
here early and often.

If you want to review some of the work please find here the link to the

Here some great leads for relevant resources:

Thanks Fred for pointing out the principles of ISOC [0] which could
for a guidance for framing this work:

The Ability to Connect. The edge-dominant end-to-end architecture of
the Internet is essential to its utility as a platform for innovation,
creativity, and economic opportunity. To preserve this quality, we
will oppose efforts to establish standards or practices that would
make it difficult or impossible for some users of the Internet to use
the full range of Internet applications of all kinds.

The Ability to Speak. The Internet is a powerful mass medium for
self-expression which depends on the ability of its users to speak
freely. We believe that the Internet must support private=E2=80=94and, wh=
ere

individuals and groups, and will oppose efforts to restrict the type
or content of information exchanged on the Internet.

The Ability to Innovate. The remarkable growth of the Internet and the
limitless variety of Internet applications follow directly from the
open model of Internet connectivity and standards development. Any
individual, organization, or company can develop and distribute a new
Internet application that can be used by anyone. We recognize the
enormous value of this innovation, and oppose governmental or
nongovernmental restrictions on the evolution and use of Internet
technology.

The Ability to Share. The many-to-many architecture of the Internet
makes it a powerful tool for sharing, education, and collaboration. It
has enabled the global open source community to develop and enhance
many of the key components of the Internet, such as the Domain Name
System and the World-Wide Web, and has made the vision of digital
libraries a reality. To preserve these benefits we will oppose
technologies and legislation that would inhibit the freedom to develop
and use open source software or limit the well-established concept of
fair use, which is essential to scholarship, education, and collaboration=

The Ability to Choose. Government regulation and the economic power of
incumbent telecommunication monopolies can delay or prevent the growth
of the Internet by limiting the ability of competitors to provide new,
better, cheaper, or more innovative Internet-related services. We
advocate policies that promote competition in telecommunications,
Internet services, Internet-related software, and e-commerce applications=

Thanks Corinne for pointing out RFC3935 [1], there are some great
pointers in here!

   The Internet: A large, heterogeneous collection of interconnected
      systems that can be used for communication of many different types
      between any interested parties connected to it.  The term includes
      both the "core Internet" (ISP networks) and "edge Internet"
      (corporate and private networks, often connected via firewalls,
      NAT boxes, application layer gateways and similar devices).  The
      Internet is a truly global network, reaching into just about every
      country in the world.
      The IETF community wants the Internet to succeed because we
      believe that the existence of the Internet, and its influence on
      economics, communication, and education, will help us to build a
      better human society.

4.1.  The Scope of the Internet

   A very difficult issue in discussing the IETF's mission has been the
   scope of the term "for the Internet".  The Internet is used for many
   things, many of which the IETF community has neither interest nor
   competence in making standards for.

   The Internet isn't value-neutral, and neither is the IETF.  We want
   the Internet to be useful for communities that share our commitment
   to openness and fairness.  We embrace technical concepts such as
   decentralized control, edge-user empowerment and sharing of
   resources, because those concepts resonate with the core values of
   the IETF community.  These concepts have little to do with the
   technology that's possible, and much to do with the technology that
   we choose to create.

   At the same time, it is clear that many of the IETF-defined
   technologies are useful not only for the Internet, but also for
   networks that have no direct relation to the Internet itself.

   In attempting to resolve the question of the IETF's scope, perhaps
   the fairest balance is struck by this formulation: "protocols and
   practices for which secure and scalable implementations are expected
   to have wide deployment and interoperation on the Internet, or to
   form part of the infrastructure of the Internet."

   In addition to this constraint, we are also constrained by the
   principle of competence: Where we do not have, and cannot gather, the
   competence needed to make technically sound standards, we should not
   attempt to take the leadership.

And as always, your questions, suggestions, comments and critiques are
very welcome.

Best,

Niels

Dear all,

I hope this email finds you well. During IETF92 I got suggested
several times to migrate this mailinglist to an official IETF
mailinglist. I am currently in the process of requesting one.

I plan to migrate all current list subscribers to the new list, which
will probably be hrpc@ietf.org.

Please let me know if you would like me to not migrate you to the new
list.

Best,

Niels

Hi,

I think that the work is important and this proposed research group
needs input from different disciplines:
IETF participants representing the technical side, but also people from
social sciences and legal sciences.

* Larry Masinter made a comment that there is also a need for
  balancing rights. He is correct in the sense that different
  stakeholders may have different objectives, because they focus
  also on different values or assets. This typically leads to
  _conflicts_, maybe even somewhere in the network as nicely
  described in [1]. Usually we use institutions like (social) norms,
  laws and courts in order to resolve such conflicts, but
  also technical systems, either implicitly or explicitly [2].
  Since the Universal declaration of human rights defines some
  of the highest values that we know, it's probably a good starting
  point. Very often different societies have different preferences
  for certain values.

* There was some discussion about protocol definition and
  intended use. I guess that the IETF always has a motivation
  and usage scenario while defining protocols, but the IETF
  usually doesn't do anything if the protocol is used in a
  different manner as originally intended. I think the main
  point here is that IETF participants could try to think about
  alternative protocol designs that may result in different
  implications for human rights etc. It may be beneficial to
  find a methodology how certain rights/values could be
  realized in a better way (e.g., data minimization for
  better privacy etc.).

* Comments on slide 13 of the presentation. Some more
  concepts came to my mind:
  - Accessibility (you need unfettered access to the
Internet/resources/information)
  - Openness (eases participation)
  - Autonomy (e.g., Autonomous System approach)
  - Federations of independent domains (ASes, Mail, XMPP servers etc.)
  Probably the latter two are sub-principles or closely related to the
  distributed nature of solutions.
  One could also view parts of the list from slide 13 hierarchically like:
  Reliability -> Robustness -> Stateless, Graceful failures/degradation,
partial healing, etc.

* On slide 15: the lower terms from "interoperable protocols ...
resilience"
  are concepts that can be used to achieve good/robust
  connectivity. However, if I have no access to that robust
  and well connected network, I'm limited in participation and
  maybe freedom of association. Therefore, accessibility may be
  also important.

Regards,
 Roland

Dear all,

Hopefully you have all been migrated to the new mailserver and the new
maillist (hrpc@irtf.org), and you have received your welcome message
from there.

Please let me know if this is not the case, so I can make sure that
everyone came over to the new list in good fashion.

The archive will be migrated as soon as possible.

It would be great if we could continue the conversation on the new list.

All the best and sorry for the inconvenience,

Niels
