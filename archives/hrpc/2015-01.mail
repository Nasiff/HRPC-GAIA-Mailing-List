Dear all,

Happy 2015! We hope it will bring us the opportunity for enlightening
and rich debates on human rights and protocols over here.

For the purpose of doing so, this is an attempt to summarize and and
structure our work. So, please, find underneath (a) the summary of the
session at IETF91 where we presented the Internet Draft on Human Rights
considerations for Internet protocols and (b) a brainstorming of some
research priorities for the coming time.

At the bottom you can also find the links for the records of the session
and related documents. The full transcription of the Q&A are also here
attached.

All comments, questions and suggestions for research methods and angles
are very welcome. We are also looking for more help of researchers who
are interested in helping us with researching specific RFCs to help us
refine the methodology. Please, feel free to ping us on or offlist.

Best,

Joana and Niels

**a) Summary of the Session*

An active debate about standards, protocols and human rights took place
during the meeting of the Security Area Advisory Group -- SAAG at IETF
91, Hawaii. The discussion was framed by the Internet Draft "Proposal
for research on human rights protocol considerations". [1]

The Draft departs from the work that has been done by IETF on privacy
and Internet protocols, such as RFC 6973 on Privacy Consideration
guidelines [2], suggesting that some standards and protocols can
solidify, enable or threaten human rights, such as freedom of expression
and the right to association online. The proposal aims to establish a
research group under the IRTF to study the structural relationship and
impact between Internet standards and protocols and freedom of
expression and association.

A deeper rationale for presenting such proposal was explained during the
presentation at SAAG. The presenters, who are also the authors of this
note highlighted that the Internet was designed with freedom and
openness of communications as core values, but were also questioning
whether this a structural value that can or needs to be preserved on a
technical level. As the politicization of the Internet management space
increases, it is argued that IETF should have an active role to promote
a more structured and holistic approach. This would allow sustained
future proofing of standards and protocols to avoid ad hoc decisions
following incidents or disclosures at a variety of other foras and actors=
=2E

The proposal raised some eyebrows and concerns about the politicization
of the work of the community. Dan Harkins posed that: "doing the human
rights study will likely politicize protocols. Not want the technology
to have political context. I want technology to be so unpolitical as
possible." This sparked a discussion with a rapid follow up by Justin,
who stated that "we have to stop pretending that technology is a
non-political decision", a remark that was followed by a round of
applause. One of the presenters responded that the research proposal was
exactly aimed at avoiding further politicization of protocols or the
community, but rather give the community time in a proper process to
define its position.

Both John Levine and Alissa Cooper remarked that it is crucial to start
of with a focus on specific human rights, because it will help keep the
research manageable and help start the thinking about the balancing of
different rights. The presenters reaffirmed that the primary focus will
indeed be on the rights to freedom of expression and right to
association.   Alissa Cooper mentioned the IAB ID  on filtering
considerations [3] and the RFC  Policy Considerations for Internet
Protocols [4] as relevant sources for research.

Several RFCs already make quite explicit statement about the objectives
of the Internet, such as RFC1958 which  mentions 'the community believes
that the goal [of the Internet] is connectivity, the tool is the
Internet Protocol'.  It continues a bit further: 'The current
exponential growth of the network seems to show that connectivity is its
own reward, and is more valuable than any individual application such
as  mail or the World-Wide Web.'  This marks the intrinsic value of
connectivity which is facilitated by the Internet, both in principle,
and in practice.  This shows that the underlying  principles of the
Internet aim to preserve connectivity, which is fundamental and similar
to the part of article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
which defines a right to receive and to impart information.

But there are also protocols that enable freedom of expression and
access to information in an unprecedented way, such as HTTP. Even though
there is not an explicit reference to rights in RFC7230, it does form
the basis for a rights enabling architecture. The challenge of the
research would be to seek out the specific protocol attribute(s) that
enable that protocol to affect a specific human right.

The major challenge as next step would be to developed to develop an
appropriate methodology to research the existing implicit safeguards in
current standards and protocols, and making them explicit. Open
discussions already gave some insights for possible methodological
approaches. Richard Barnes suggests: "seems that you are reading RFCs
and that you are looking for statement on rights and human rights that
are laid out in RFCs. You might risk irritating people at least by
reading reading technical documents as political statements. I think it
might be more useful to use RFCs as a window into the rights that the
community that developed these RFCs presumes." Mark Nottingham also
proposed a perspective of stakeholder prioritization as described in ID
Representing Stakeholder Rights in Internet Protocols [5]  which is as
already implemented at the W3C.

Other very useful remarks were made during and after the session, as
well on the mailinglist [6] which are currently being used to improve
the next version of the draft, possibly, to be further discussed at a
Birds of Feather session in Dallas.
*
**b) Research priorities and next steps*

The proceedings of this session lead the presenters and authors of the
ID to conclude that the subject and the research raised interest in the
community. Their aim is to continue the research work an produce an
updated ID before the Dallas meeting.

The research in the coming time will focus on documenting the specific
protocol attributes that explicitly or implicitly affect specific human
rights. For achieving that, a research methodology will be further
developed; suggestions for the first steps consist of:

a) improving the list of RFCs that possibly have attributes to the right
to freedom of expression and association;

b) conduct interviews at the Dallas meeting to further understand the
intention that Area Directors and RFC authors have with specific
protocols and how rights play a role in that;

c) set a common template to analyze standards and protocols describing
the exact features, functions, characteristics or entities that allow a
more defined understanding on the relation between them and the right to
freedom of expression and association.

Nevertheless, these are just our suggestions to keep developing the ID
and the work ahead of it. Comments, suggestions, hints are more then
welcome and very much appreciated.

=E2=80=8BHello all,

I would love to be involved in this research! I'm currently a master
student at the Oxford Internet Institute

and have a background in human rights and tech. please let me know in what
capacity I could be of use.

Best,

Dear all,<br>
<br>
Happy 2015! We hope it will bring us the opportunity for enlightening<br>
and rich debates on human rights and protocols over here.<br>
<br>
For the purpose of doing so, this is an attempt to summarize and and<br>
structure our work. So, please, find underneath (a) the summary of the<br>
session at IETF91 where we presented the Internet Draft on Human Rights<br>
considerations for Internet protocols and (b) a brainstorming of some<br>
research priorities for the coming time.<br>
<br>
At the bottom you can also find the links for the records of the session<br=
>
and related documents. The full transcription of the Q&amp;A are also here<=
br>
attached.<br>
<br>
All comments, questions and suggestions for research methods and angles<br>
are very welcome. We are also looking for more help of researchers who<br>
are interested in helping us with researching specific RFCs to help us<br>
refine the methodology. Please, feel free to ping us on or offlist.<br>
<br>
Best,<br>
<br>
Joana and Niels<br>

*<br>
**a) Summary of the Session*<br>
<br>
An active debate about standards, protocols and human rights took place<br>
during the meeting of the Security Area Advisory Group -- SAAG at IETF<br>
91, Hawaii. The discussion was framed by the Internet Draft &quot;Proposal<=
br>
for research on human rights protocol considerations&quot;. [1]<br>
<br>
The Draft departs from the work that has been done by IETF on privacy<br>
and Internet protocols, such as RFC 6973 on Privacy Consideration<br>
guidelines [2], suggesting that some standards and protocols can<br>
solidify, enable or threaten human rights, such as freedom of expression<br=
>
and the right to association online. The proposal aims to establish a<br>
research group under the IRTF to study the structural relationship and<br>
impact between Internet standards and protocols and freedom of<br>
expression and association.<br>
<br>
A deeper rationale for presenting such proposal was explained during the<br=
>
presentation at SAAG. The presenters, who are also the authors of this<br>
note highlighted that the Internet was designed with freedom and<br>
openness of communications as core values, but were also questioning<br>
whether this a structural value that can or needs to be preserved on a<br>
technical level. As the politicization of the Internet management space<br>
increases, it is argued that IETF should have an active role to promote<br>
a more structured and holistic approach. This would allow sustained<br>
future proofing of standards and protocols to avoid ad hoc decisions<br>
following incidents or disclosures at a variety of other foras and actors.<=
br>
<br>
The proposal raised some eyebrows and concerns about the politicization<br>
of the work of the community. Dan Harkins posed that: &quot;doing the human=
<br>
rights study will likely politicize protocols. Not want the technology<br>
to have political context. I want technology to be so unpolitical as<br>
possible.&quot; This sparked a discussion with a rapid follow up by Justin,=
<br>
who stated that &quot;we have to stop pretending that technology is a<br>
non-political decision&quot;, a remark that was followed by a round of<br>
applause. One of the presenters responded that the research proposal was<br=
>
exactly aimed at avoiding further politicization of protocols or the<br>
community, but rather give the community time in a proper process to<br>
define its position.<br>
<br>
Both John Levine and Alissa Cooper remarked that it is crucial to start<br>
of with a focus on specific human rights, because it will help keep the<br>
research manageable and help start the thinking about the balancing of<br>
different rights. The presenters reaffirmed that the primary focus will<br>
indeed be on the rights to freedom of expression and right to<br>
association.=C2=A0 =C2=A0Alissa Cooper mentioned the IAB ID=C2=A0 on filter=
ing<br>
considerations [3] and the RFC=C2=A0 Policy Considerations for Internet<br>
Protocols [4] as relevant sources for research.<br>
<br>
Several RFCs already make quite explicit statement about the objectives<br>
of the Internet, such as RFC1958 which=C2=A0 mentions &#39;the community be=
lieves<br>
that the goal [of the Internet] is connectivity, the tool is the<br>
Internet Protocol&#39;.=C2=A0 It continues a bit further: &#39;The current<=
br>
exponential growth of the network seems to show that connectivity is its<br=
>
own reward, and is more valuable than any individual application such<br>
as=C2=A0 mail or the World-Wide Web.&#39;=C2=A0 This marks the intrinsic va=
lue of<br>
connectivity which is facilitated by the Internet, both in principle,<br>
and in practice.=C2=A0 This shows that the underlying=C2=A0 principles of t=
he<br>
Internet aim to preserve connectivity, which is fundamental and similar<br>
to the part of article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,<br>
which defines a right to receive and to impart information.<br>
<br>
But there are also protocols that enable freedom of expression and<br>
access to information in an unprecedented way, such as HTTP. Even though<br=
>
there is not an explicit reference to rights in RFC7230, it does form<br>
the basis for a rights enabling architecture. The challenge of the<br>
research would be to seek out the specific protocol attribute(s) that<br>
enable that protocol to affect a specific human right.<br>
<br>
The major challenge as next step would be to developed to develop an<br>
appropriate methodology to research the existing implicit safeguards in<br>
current standards and protocols, and making them explicit. Open<br>
discussions already gave some insights for possible methodological<br>
approaches. Richard Barnes suggests: &quot;seems that you are reading RFCs<=
br>
and that you are looking for statement on rights and human rights that<br>
are laid out in RFCs. You might risk irritating people at least by<br>
reading reading technical documents as political statements. I think it<br>
might be more useful to use RFCs as a window into the rights that the<br>
community that developed these RFCs presumes.&quot; Mark Nottingham also<br=
>
proposed a perspective of stakeholder prioritization as described in ID<br>
Representing Stakeholder Rights in Internet Protocols [5]=C2=A0 which is as=
<br>
already implemented at the W3C.<br>
<br>
Other very useful remarks were made during and after the session, as<br>
well on the mailinglist [6] which are currently being used to improve<br>
the next version of the draft, possibly, to be further discussed at a<br>
Birds of Feather session in Dallas.<br>
*<br>
**b) Research priorities and next steps*<br>
<br>
The proceedings of this session lead the presenters and authors of the<br>
ID to conclude that the subject and the research raised interest in the<br>
community. Their aim is to continue the research work an produce an<br>
updated ID before the Dallas meeting.<br>
<br>
The research in the coming time will focus on documenting the specific<br>
protocol attributes that explicitly or implicitly affect specific human<br>
rights. For achieving that, a research methodology will be further<br>
developed; suggestions for the first steps consist of:<br>
<br>
a) improving the list of RFCs that possibly have attributes to the right<br=
>
to freedom of expression and association;<br>
<br>
b) conduct interviews at the Dallas meeting to further understand the<br>
intention that Area Directors and RFC authors have with specific<br>
protocols and how rights play a role in that;<br>
<br>
c) set a common template to analyze standards and protocols describing<br>
the exact features, functions, characteristics or entities that allow a<br>
more defined understanding on the relation between them and the right to<br=
>
freedom of expression and association.<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, these are just our suggestions to keep developing the ID<br>
and the work ahead of it. Comments, suggestions, hints are more then<br>
welcome and very much appreciated.<br>

Hiya,

And adding to the welcome flurry of traffic on this list...

UNESCO are doing a study that seems relevant here and will have
a conference in Paris on that March 2-4. [1] (I'll be there on
some panel or other:-)

Seems like it overlaps with this effort some as they are also
considering how human rights and the Internet are related I
think.

Cheers,
S.

Hi joana

Congrats on sparking an interesting debate at the IETF in Hawaii. I
found all comments in the transcript useful, even those that questioned
the foundation of the research. In particular, I thought the suggestion
to analyze RFCs carefully for assumptions of rights is a better approach
than searching for overt mentions of rights. Interviews in Dallas could
certainly give more weight to the findings if we take this approach.

Questioning the apolitics of protocols is really a fundamental goal of
this work. I think while difficult, it would also be extremely
productive to continue to engage with folks in the community who feel
technology should strive to be apolitical, thereby developing a very
strong counterposition.

Very happy to lend a hand with this work,
-Mallory

    Hi joana<br>
    <br>
    Congrats on sparking an interesting debate at the IETF in Hawaii. I
    found all comments in the transcript useful, even those that
    questioned the foundation of the research. In particular, I thought
    the suggestion to analyze RFCs carefully for assumptions of rights
    is a better approach than searching for overt mentions of rights.
    Interviews in Dallas could certainly give more weight to the
    findings if we take this approach.<br>
    <br>
    Questioning the apolitics of protocols is really a fundamental goal
    of this work. I think while difficult, it would also be extremely
    productive to continue to engage with folks in the community who
    feel technology should strive to be apolitical, thereby developing a
    very strong counterposition.<br>
    <br>
    Very happy to lend a hand with this work,<br>
    -Mallory<br>

      Dear all,<br>
      <br>
      Happy 2015! We hope it will bring us the opportunity for
      enlightening and rich debates on human rights and protocols over
      here.<br>
      <br>
      For the purpose of doing so, this is an attempt to summarize and
      and structure our work. So, please, find underneath (a) the
      summary of the session at IETF91 where we presented the Internet
      Draft on Human Rights considerations for Internet protocols and
      (b) a brainstorming of some research priorities for the coming
      time.<br>
      <br>
      At the bottom you can also find the links for the records of the
      session and related documents. The full transcription of the
      Q&amp;A are also here attached.<br>
      <br>
      All comments, questions and suggestions for research methods and
      angles are very welcome. We are also looking for more help of
      researchers who are interested in helping us with researching
      specific RFCs to help us refine the methodology. Please, feel free
      to ping us on or offlist.<br>

      <b><br>
      </b><b>a) Summary of the Session</b><br>
      <br>
      An active debate about standards, protocols and human rights took
      place during the meeting of the Security Area Advisory Group &#8211=
;
      SAAG at IETF 91, Hawaii. The discussion was framed by the Internet
      Draft &#8220;Proposal for research on human rights protocol
      considerations&#8221;. [1]<br>
      <br>
      The Draft departs from the work that has been done by IETF on
      privacy and Internet protocols, such as RFC 6973 on Privacy
      Consideration guidelines [2], suggesting that some standards and
      protocols can solidify, enable or threaten human rights, such as
      freedom of expression and the right to association online. The
      proposal aims to establish a research group under the IRTF to
      study the structural relationship and impact between Internet
      standards and protocols and freedom of expression and association.<=
br>
      <br>
      A deeper rationale for presenting such proposal was explained
      during the presentation at SAAG. The presenters, who are also the
      authors of this note highlighted that the Internet was designed
      with freedom and openness of communications as core values, but
      were also questioning whether this a structural value that can or
      needs to be preserved on a technical level. As the politicization
      of the Internet management space increases, it is argued that IETF
      should have an active role to promote a more structured and
      holistic approach. This would allow sustained future proofing of
      standards and protocols to avoid ad hoc decisions following
      incidents or disclosures at a variety of other foras and actors.<br=
>
      <br>
      The proposal raised some eyebrows and concerns about the
      politicization of the work of the community. Dan Harkins posed
      that: &#8220;doing the human rights study will likely politicize
      protocols. Not want the technology to have political context. I
      want technology to be so unpolitical as possible.&#8221; This spark=
ed a
      discussion with a rapid follow up by Justin, who stated that &#8220=
;we
      have to stop pretending that technology is a non-political
      decision&#8221;, a remark that was followed by a round of applause.=
 One
      of the presenters responded that the research proposal was exactly
      aimed at avoiding further politicization of protocols or the
      community, but rather give the community time in a proper process
      to define its position.<br>
      <br>
      Both John Levine and Alissa Cooper remarked that it is crucial to
      start of with a focus on specific human rights, because it will
      help keep the research manageable and help start the thinking
      about the balancing of different rights. The presenters reaffirmed
      that the primary focus will indeed be on the rights to freedom of
      expression and right to association.&nbsp;&nbsp; Alissa Cooper ment=
ioned the
      IAB ID&nbsp; on filtering considerations [3] and the RFC&nbsp; Poli=
cy
      Considerations for Internet Protocols [4] as relevant sources for
      research.<br>
      <br>
      Several RFCs already make quite explicit statement about the
      objectives of the Internet, such as RFC1958 which&nbsp; mentions 't=
he
      community believes that the goal [of the Internet] is
      connectivity, the tool is the Internet Protocol'.&nbsp; It continue=
s a
      bit further: 'The current exponential growth of the network seems
      to show that connectivity is its own reward, and is more valuable
      than any individual application such as&nbsp; mail or the World-Wid=
e
      Web.'&nbsp; This marks the intrinsic value of connectivity which is=

      facilitated by the Internet, both in principle, and in practice.&nb=
sp;
      This shows that the underlying&nbsp; principles of the Internet aim=
 to
      preserve connectivity, which is fundamental and similar to the
      part of article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
      which defines a right to receive and to impart information.<br>
      <br>
      But there are also protocols that enable freedom of expression and
      access to information in an unprecedented way, such as HTTP. Even
      though there is not an explicit reference to rights in RFC7230, it
      does form the basis for a rights enabling architecture. The
      challenge of the research would be to seek out the specific
      protocol attribute(s) that enable that protocol to affect a
      specific human right.<br>
      <br>
      The major challenge as next step would be to developed to develop
      an appropriate methodology to research the existing implicit
      safeguards in current standards and protocols, and making them
      explicit. Open discussions already gave some insights for possible
      methodological approaches. Richard Barnes suggests: &#8220;seems th=
at
      you are reading RFCs and that you are looking for statement on
      rights and human rights that are laid out in RFCs. You might risk
      irritating people at least by reading reading technical documents
      as political statements. I think it might be more useful to use
      RFCs as a window into the rights that the community that developed
      these RFCs presumes.&#8221; Mark Nottingham also proposed a perspec=
tive
      of stakeholder prioritization as described in ID Representing
      Stakeholder Rights in Internet Protocols [5]&nbsp; which is as alre=
ady
      implemented at the W3C.<br>
      <br>
      Other very useful remarks were made during and after the session,
      as well on the mailinglist [6] which are currently being used to
      improve the next version of the draft, possibly, to be further
      discussed at a Birds of Feather session in Dallas.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>b) Research priorities and next steps</b><br>
      <br>
      The proceedings of this session lead the presenters and authors of
      the ID to conclude that the subject and the research raised
      interest in the community. Their aim is to continue the research
      work an produce an updated ID before the Dallas meeting.<br>
      <br>
      The research in the coming time will focus on documenting the
      specific protocol attributes that explicitly or implicitly affect
      specific human rights. For achieving that, a research methodology
      will be further developed; suggestions for the first steps consist
      of:<br>
      <br>
      a) improving the list of RFCs that possibly have attributes to the
      right to freedom of expression and association;<br>
      <br>
      b) conduct interviews at the Dallas meeting to further understand
      the intention that Area Directors and RFC authors have with
      specific protocols and how rights play a role in that;<br>
      <br>
      c) set a common template to analyze standards and protocols
      describing the exact features, functions, characteristics or
      entities that allow a more defined understanding on the relation
      between them and the right to freedom of expression and
      association.<br>
      <br>
      Nevertheless, these are just our suggestions to keep developing
      the ID and the work ahead of it. Comments, suggestions, hints are
      more then welcome and very much appreciated. <br>

Dear Mallory, Corinne et all

Very thankful for the feedback and indeed every help is very welcome.
I'll quickly convene with Niels and Avri to double check if we can
extract a list of small activities to perform the first steps mentioned
bellow:

"a) improving the list of RFCs that possibly have attributes to the
right to freedom of expression and association;

b) conduct interviews at the Dallas meeting to further understand the
intention that Area Directors and RFC authors have with specific
protocols and how rights play a role in that;

c) set a common template to analyze standards and protocols describing
the exact features, functions, characteristics or entities that allow a
more defined understanding on the relation between them and the right to
freedom of expression and association."

and I would say that it would be great if we could set a little task
force to cover then according to your availabilities. If we manage to do
so, we can hav work flowing until Dallas, while we also keep reporting
our progresses and asking for comments in this list as it evolves. Are
you up for a call to coordinate?

best

      Hi joana<br>
      <br>
      Congrats on sparking an interesting debate at the IETF in Hawaii.
      I found all comments in the transcript useful, even those that
      questioned the foundation of the research. In particular, I
      thought the suggestion to analyze RFCs carefully for assumptions
      of rights is a better approach than searching for overt mentions
      of rights. Interviews in Dallas could certainly give more weight
      to the findings if we take this approach.<br>
      <br>
      Questioning the apolitics of protocols is really a fundamental
      goal of this work. I think while difficult, it would also be
      extremely productive to continue to engage with folks in the
      community who feel technology should strive to be apolitical,
      thereby developing a very strong counterposition.<br>
      <br>
      Very happy to lend a hand with this work,<br>

        <b><br>
        </b><b>a) Summary of the Session</b><br>
        <br>
        An active debate about standards, protocols and human rights
        took place during the meeting of the Security Area Advisory
        Group &#8211; SAAG at IETF 91, Hawaii. The discussion was framed by
        the Internet Draft &#8220;Proposal for research on human rights
        protocol considerations&#8221;. [1]<br>
        <br>
        The Draft departs from the work that has been done by IETF on
        privacy and Internet protocols, such as RFC 6973 on Privacy
        Consideration guidelines [2], suggesting that some standards and
        protocols can solidify, enable or threaten human rights, such as
        freedom of expression and the right to association online. The
        proposal aims to establish a research group under the IRTF to
        study the structural relationship and impact between Internet
        standards and protocols and freedom of expression and
        association.<br>
        <br>
        A deeper rationale for presenting such proposal was explained
        during the presentation at SAAG. The presenters, who are also
        the authors of this note highlighted that the Internet was
        designed with freedom and openness of communications as core
        values, but were also questioning whether this a structural
        value that can or needs to be preserved on a technical level. As
        the politicization of the Internet management space increases,
        it is argued that IETF should have an active role to promote a
        more structured and holistic approach. This would allow
        sustained future proofing of standards and protocols to avoid ad
        hoc decisions following incidents or disclosures at a variety of
        other foras and actors.<br>
        <br>
        The proposal raised some eyebrows and concerns about the
        politicization of the work of the community. Dan Harkins posed
        that: &#8220;doing the human rights study will likely politicize
        protocols. Not want the technology to have political context. I
        want technology to be so unpolitical as possible.&#8221; This sparked
        a discussion with a rapid follow up by Justin, who stated that
        &#8220;we have to stop pretending that technology is a non-political
        decision&#8221;, a remark that was followed by a round of applause.
        One of the presenters responded that the research proposal was
        exactly aimed at avoiding further politicization of protocols or
        the community, but rather give the community time in a proper
        process to define its position.<br>
        <br>
        Both John Levine and Alissa Cooper remarked that it is crucial
        to start of with a focus on specific human rights, because it
        will help keep the research manageable and help start the
        thinking about the balancing of different rights. The presenters
        reaffirmed that the primary focus will indeed be on the rights
        to freedom of expression and right to association.&nbsp;&nbsp; Alissa
        Cooper mentioned the IAB ID&nbsp; on filtering considerations [3] and
        the RFC&nbsp; Policy Considerations for Internet Protocols [4] as
        relevant sources for research.<br>
        <br>
        Several RFCs already make quite explicit statement about the
        objectives of the Internet, such as RFC1958 which&nbsp; mentions 'the
        community believes that the goal [of the Internet] is
        connectivity, the tool is the Internet Protocol'.&nbsp; It continues
        a bit further: 'The current exponential growth of the network
        seems to show that connectivity is its own reward, and is more
        valuable than any individual application such as&nbsp; mail or the
        World-Wide Web.'&nbsp; This marks the intrinsic value of connectivity
        which is facilitated by the Internet, both in principle, and in
        practice.&nbsp; This shows that the underlying&nbsp; principles of the
        Internet aim to preserve connectivity, which is fundamental and
        similar to the part of article 19 of the Universal Declaration
        of Human Rights, which defines a right to receive and to impart
        information.<br>
        <br>
        But there are also protocols that enable freedom of expression
        and access to information in an unprecedented way, such as HTTP.
        Even though there is not an explicit reference to rights in
        RFC7230, it does form the basis for a rights enabling
        architecture. The challenge of the research would be to seek out
        the specific protocol attribute(s) that enable that protocol to
        affect a specific human right.<br>
        <br>
        The major challenge as next step would be to developed to
        develop an appropriate methodology to research the existing
        implicit safeguards in current standards and protocols, and
        making them explicit. Open discussions already gave some
        insights for possible methodological approaches. Richard Barnes
        suggests: &#8220;seems that you are reading RFCs and that you are
        looking for statement on rights and human rights that are laid
        out in RFCs. You might risk irritating people at least by
        reading reading technical documents as political statements. I
        think it might be more useful to use RFCs as a window into the
        rights that the community that developed these RFCs presumes.&#8221;
        Mark Nottingham also proposed a perspective of stakeholder
        prioritization as described in ID Representing Stakeholder
        Rights in Internet Protocols [5]&nbsp; which is as already
        implemented at the W3C.<br>
        <br>
        Other very useful remarks were made during and after the
        session, as well on the mailinglist [6] which are currently
        being used to improve the next version of the draft, possibly,
        to be further discussed at a Birds of Feather session in Dallas.<br>
        <b><br>
        </b><b>b) Research priorities and next steps</b><br>
        <br>
        The proceedings of this session lead the presenters and authors
        of the ID to conclude that the subject and the research raised
        interest in the community. Their aim is to continue the research
        work an produce an updated ID before the Dallas meeting.<br>
        <br>
        The research in the coming time will focus on documenting the
        specific protocol attributes that explicitly or implicitly
        affect specific human rights. For achieving that, a research
        methodology will be further developed; suggestions for the first
        steps consist of:<br>
        <br>
        a) improving the list of RFCs that possibly have attributes to
        the right to freedom of expression and association;<br>
        <br>
        b) conduct interviews at the Dallas meeting to further
        understand the intention that Area Directors and RFC authors
        have with specific protocols and how rights play a role in that;<br>
        <br>
        c) set a common template to analyze standards and protocols
        describing the exact features, functions, characteristics or
        entities that allow a more defined understanding on the relation
        between them and the right to freedom of expression and
        association.<br>
        <br>
        Nevertheless, these are just our suggestions to keep developing
        the ID and the work ahead of it. Comments, suggestions, hints
        are more then welcome and very much appreciated. <br>

Hi all,

Thanks for the feedback and the enthusiasm! While we're trying to
secure a session at the IETF in Dallas it might be useful to have a
joint look at one RFC and see how we can establish it's impact on
human rights.

I have setup this sheet: https://www.ethercalc.org/tdeh4wx2zo, but
this is hardly enough of a template/lens/methodology to analyze the
RFCs. So perhaps we could all have a look at RFC7230 [0] and see how we
can define its impact on human rights. Once we have done that, we
might be able to distill from this a loose methodology that we can
then test on other RFCs.

I specifically chose an RFC that doesn't (more or less) explicitly
reference rights (such as RFC1958 and RFC4924), because in my humble
opinion we should try to establish the link between actual protocols
and standards and their impact on rights.

If we could share our reflections here that could form a useful start
for a discussion. What do you think?

A call will be hard to plan for me in the coming week because of travel.

Looking forward to read your contemplations.

Best,

Niels

Hi,

I don't know whether it is a BoF or there is some other designation for
an IRTF session for a 'RG in possible formation.'  In any case,
following up on the interest in the SAAG session, and afterwards, we
(Joana, Niels and I) would like to request such a session.

At the end of the requested session, the goal would be to discuss the
formation of a RG.  But we would like to make it substantive and include
the following discussion items:

1) Continue the discussion on the interrelation between protocols,
architectures and rights

2) Enable broad community engagement in this discussion as was discussed
in Hawaii.

3) Allow this discussion to happen before politicization related to
human rights and the Internet occurs.

A major premise of our research goals is future-proofing protocols in
relation to their effect on human rights. If we can discover a reliable
set of considerations, we may avoid needing to fix as many protocols
retroactively going forward. We believe that our goal, consistent with
RFC1958, is for the Internet to continue to serve as a tool enabling
connectivity among all people. Attacks on the Internet's ability to do
this are increasing and worrisome.

I think we could use a full session for the discussion, but one of the
shorter slots would probably work.

Lars, please let us know of any specific information you need or
specific steps you would like us to take in following up on this request.=


We would also be intersted in hearing from the list as to other things
that might be worth adding to the such a discussion so that we can
adjust the proposed 'agenda' to suit. Optimally we can evolve from the 3
of us trying to get this going to a group working on moving it forward.=20
But time was getting late for requesting a slot and we felt we needed to
get this moving.

Thanks

Hi,

Thanks for the really fast response.  I really appreciate the approach
you take on 'proposed RG's, and really did not want to have to work on a
charter just yet.

My first approach at answers regarding the session.

* what kind of meeting do you want to hold in Dallas (on the agenda, or o=
ff)

On the agenda, as I think it would be good to reach out to other who
might be interested.

I think a 90 minute slot would be good for this first session.

I have personal conflict I would like to avoid in scheduling, the IANA
transiton subject.  Additionally we should avoid conflict with the SAAG
meeting as there is where we found many interested in the discussion at
the last meeting and any meetings dealing with privacy consideration
issues.  We can build a conflict list over the next days if people need
to add some.

* do you have a mailing list?

Yes, hrpc@article19.io <hrpc@article19.io>

* do you have a group of people with energy to make the group successful?=


Not sure yet.  There are at least 3 of us committed to the work and a
bunch of others who have shown interest.  There appeared to be interest
in continuing the discussion at the SAAG meeting, but it is still early
to know.  What I do believe is that we need to continue the approach
that started there and see if we can build something.

* do you have some description of the group? (below is an OK start)

I would use this  as a start.

A major premise of our research goals is future-proofing protocols in
relation to their effect on human rights. If we can discover a reliable
set of considerations, we may avoid needing to fix as many protocols
retroactively going forward. We believe that our goal, consistent with
RFC1958, is for the Internet to continue to serve as a tool enabling
connectivity among all people. Attacks on the Internet's ability to do
this are increasing and worrisome.

Some of the topics we want to discuss:

1) Continue the discussion on the interrelation between protocols,
architectures and rights

2) Enable broad community engagement in this discussion as was discussed
in Hawaii.

3) Allow this discussion to happen before politicization related to
human rights and the Internet occurs.

4) Discuss methods for doing the work.

Thanks

avri

Hi,

That's not quite how I handle this in the IRTF. For folks that come with =
an idea for a new RG, I'm willing to give them meeting rooms at IETF =
meetings for a year, and (if they like) have the meeting listed on the =
agenda as a "proposed RG" meeting. (It is also possible to have some of =
these meetings off the agenda, i.e., with invitations handled by the =
proponents of the group.) The instructions to the proponents are =
basically "go and pretend you are an RG", in other words, invite the =
people you want to invite, have the discussions you want to have and =
don't worry about the charter text.

After that year has passed, I sit down with the proponents, the IRSG and =
IAB and we discuss if the proposed group is off to a good start.

The reason I'm doing it this way is that I've seen to many new RGs in =
the past focus on charter text, get it perfect and then die on the =
starting line because of lack of energy or lack of community building by =
the proponents. So I've decided to front-load that, and fine tune the =
charter afterwards.

Of course you will need some sort of text to explain the group to new =
people, so they can determine if it's for them, but it doesn't need to =
be as formal as a charter.

So:

* what kind of meeting do you want to hold in Dallas (on the agenda, or =
off)

* do you have a mailing list?

* do you have a group of people with energy to make the group =
successful?

* do you have some description of the group? (below is an OK start)


>  But we would like to make it substantive and include the following =
discussion items:
>=20
> 1) Continue the discussion on the interrelation between protocols, =
architectures and rights
>=20
> 2) Enable broad community engagement in this discussion as was =
discussed in Hawaii.
>=20
> 3) Allow this discussion to happen before politicization related to =
human rights and the Internet occurs.
>=20
> A major premise of our research goals is future-proofing protocols in =
relation to their effect on human rights. If we can discover a reliable =
set of considerations, we may avoid needing to fix as many protocols =
retroactively going forward. We believe that our goal, consistent with =
RFC1958, is for the Internet to continue to serve as a tool enabling =
connectivity among all people. Attacks on the Internet's ability to do =
this are increasing and worrisome.
>=20
> I think we could use a full session for the discussion, but one of the =
shorter slots would probably work.

If you want an "on the agenda" meeting, you need to determine how many =
hours it should be (1h, 1.5h, 2h, 2.5h) and you need to determine your =
list of conflicts with other RGs and WGs.

If you want an "off the agenda" meeting, those are not scheduled in =
parallel to WG and RG sessions, so it would need to be breakfast, lunch =
or evening time.

> Lars, please let us know of any specific information you need or =

See above.

Hi,

there is now https://datatracker.ietf.org/rg/hrpc/charter/

I made Avri and Niels chairs, mostly because Joana didn't have a =
datatracker account. (We can change this.)

This should either of you request an on-the-agenda session for Dallas =
via https://datatracker.ietf.org/secr/sreq/

Please note =
http://www.ietf.org/meeting/important-dates-2015.html#ietf92; the =
deadline for requests is 2015-02-06.

Lars

Hi all,

I was wondering whether a longer session might be beneficial as well.
So we get to discuss and further some ideas, and not only comment on
them? Or would that need more of a workshop set-up? I would propose
going for 120 minutes, we can always stop earlier, no ?

I like this description:

But are we not politicizing this issue with the last sentence?

It can also be said that recent attacks have not been on connectivity
but on privacy, no? Just thinking in terms of strategy and inclusion
of the community in this discussion.

Furthermore, we haven't formally established the relationship between
Freedom of Expression and connectivity yet. Or is this something we
can simply assume?

Best,

Niels

Hi all,

I was wondering whether a longer session might be beneficial as well.
So we get to discuss and further some ideas, and not only comment on
them? Or would that need more of a workshop set-up? I would propose
going for 120 minutes, we can always stop earlier, no ?

I like this description:

But are we not politicizing this issue with the last sentence?

It can also be said that recent attacks have not been on connectivity
but on privacy, no? Just thinking in terms of strategy and inclusion
of the community in this discussion.

Furthermore, we haven't formally established the relationship between
Freedom of Expression and connectivity yet. Or is this something we
can simply assume?

Best,

Niels
