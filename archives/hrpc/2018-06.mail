The <draft-irtf-hrpc-guidelines-00.txt> draft states =E2=80=93

" According to these documents, some examples of human rights relevant
   for ICT systems are human dignity (Art. 1 UDHR), non-discrimination
   (Art. 2), rights to life, liberty and security (Art. 3), freedom of

 John

I could not more strongly disagree with your interpretation of 'human right=
s' (besides your confusion between encryption and anonymity).

1. To be clear, human rights do not apply to=C2=A0 corporations (corporate =
bodies).

2. The 'right' to legal remedy is not a Human Right but a mechanism to aid =
in the enforcement in the other rights, which is why it is in Article 2 (Hu=
man Rights are spelt out in Articles 6-27).

3. In the main, Human Rights are state obligations to refrain from interfer=
ence with individual rights (negative rights) and only secondarily an oblig=
ation to prevent citizens from such interference (positive right).

4. All rights are subject to the test of 'proportionality' (excepting certa=
in rights described in Article 2, which are absolute). This means that one =
right cannot be enforced to the annihilation of another.

5. Given the importance of encryption and anonymity to freedom of expressio=
n and right to privacy, various organisations (eg. Article 19 <https://www.=
article19.org/resources/un-expert-launches-robust-defence-online-anonymity-=
encryption/>) and the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of=
 the right to freedom of opinion and expression <www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/=
HRC/RegularSessions/Session29/Documents/A.HRC.29.32_AEV.doc> have emphasise=
d that the use of encryption and anonymity are essential in the protection =
of fundamental rights.

6. Even conceding your point about the ability for legal redress for infrin=
gement against Human Rights (and NOT for other purposes), this would apply =
only to anonymity and not encryption.

 Hi John

You are correct regarding the Universal Declaration, which is only 'declara=
tory'. I was referring to the signed treaty - the International Covenant on=
 Civil and Political Rights - and its enforcement mechanisms.

You quote my point 6 (encryption vs anonymity), but I assume from your foll=
owing comment you meant to quote my point 4 regarding proportionality.

I do have a specific position regarding the proportionality test, as do Art=
icle 19 and the Special Rapporteur. Given the possible misunderstanding tha=
t you have pointed out, I would suggest that the 'Guidelines for Human Righ=
ts Protocol Considerations' should specifically cite the Special Rapporteur=
 when refering to encryption/anonymity.

Regards
Mark P.

Mark -

Are you suggestion that the IETF conduct reviews of human rights impacts for=
 protocols but that such =E2=80=9Ccomprehensive=E2=80=9D assessments do not n=
eed to consider the human right of effective remedy?

I am fine if the reviews exclude the human right to effective remedy, but th=
en believe that care must be taken to make sure such reviews are not represe=
nted as =E2=80=9Ccomprehensive=E2=80=9D.  Alternatively, assessment of impac=
ts to the right to effective remedy could be included - either outcome is re=
asonable so long as it avoids inadvertent misrepresentation.=20

Thanks!
/John

Hiya,

I don't have a position on the UDHR aspects of the discussion but
I have a comment on terminology and I'm not clear what's behind the
text below...

On 10/06/18 12:46, John Curran wrote:

I think the above mixes too many things together to be any kind of
example that might be useful in the discussion.

John, it's not clear to me if you're bemoaning:

- folks' ability to use confidentiality mechanisms
- use of combinations of standard and non-standard protocols
  in ways that didn't first ask for permission from someone
  (and thus are hard to disentangle)
- the fact that it is hard to correlate source addresses with
  entities one might sue or complain about to your chosen local
  authorities
- or something else

But regardless of what is or is not a human right, I think that reviews
considering human rights in this context clearly also need to consider
the ability to run networks that are constantly under attack, so I think
most of this is moot really.

On terminology: use of the term "anonymity" here is not useful either.
(I think Mark is the person who did that first in this thread, sorry
if I got that wrong.) I find it really hard to know when or if someone
using that term understands the tremendous difficulties in attempting
to be really anonymous. And I have seen people mistakenly use that term
when they really just meant use of ciphertext instead of plaintext. So
it'd be better to not use that term at all in these discussion I think.
(It's much easier to talk accurately about use of pseudonyms anyway:-)

Cheers,
S.

This draft itself uses the UDHR as a basis.=C2=A0 John's point is that th=
ere
is a tension between these various rights.=C2=A0 Similarly, Section 3.2.4=

references BCP72 and talks about a "Right to security", but we haven't
had a real discussion of what that means.

One other comment:

The document really needs a scrub on terminology.=C2=A0 For instance, Sec=
tion
3.2.13 talks about reliability and degradation, when the example really
discusses downgrade attacks.=C2=A0 The second example (TCP ACKs) is not w=
ell
connected to the point.

 Stephen

On terminology, it was me who first used the term "anonymity' in this discu=
ssion. It was a logical leap (without explanation) from Johns connecting at=
tribution to legal redress. Pseudonymity has not much impact on legal redre=
ss unless it can be connected to a real human; if it cannot be so connected=
, the human remain anonymous...

I agree with your points regarding clarity, something the "Anonymity, Human=
 Rights and Internet Protocols" draft deals with.

However, I disagree with your view that the "need to consider
the ability to run networks that are constantly under attack" renders this =
moot. Attribution (in terms of legal redress) is NOT necessary for this pur=
pose...

Eliot

The draft does not use the UDHR as a basis. It refers to the UDHR, the ICCP=
R and other treaties, but only cites examples from the UDHR. These examples=
 are all found in the ICCPR excepting:

'appropriate social and
international order', which is the purpose of the treaties;

'participation in cultural life...' which is dealt with in another treaty -=
 the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.

I totally agree that there is a tension between these various rights, somet=
hing recognised by the various enforcement & monitoring bodies of the treat=
ies. This why I prefer to refer to the treaties rather than the UDHR, it en=
ables reference to General Comments and agreed analyses of the treaties and=
 the tensions between the rights contained in them, something the UDHR does=
 not.

Perhaps we should look at whether our examples should come from the Treatie=
s rather than the UDHR. The majority of countries are signatories to the IC=
CPR and other relevant treaties, while the UDHR is only by default due to c=
ountries UN membership.

As to 'a scrub on terminology', I totally agree; have attempted to aid in p=
roof-reading and polishing myself, but is clearly not finished.

In fact, your reference to 3.2.4 and Right to Security illustrates this poi=
nt as it seems to conflate / confuse network security with the 'Right to se=
curity' with not explanation...

Regards
Mark P.

 You are correct regarding the Universal Declaration, which is only 'declar=

That's not the problem I was describing. The problem I was trying to
get at is that anonymity is almost impossible, *technically*. For me,
that does not mean we ought give up and aim for a fully identified
network, rather the opposite - I figure we ought be figuring out how
to make less easily identifiable networking more usable, both for
people using network services and for people managing networks. (That
latter set of folks may currently disagree with me that the less they
have access to superfluous data related to people using their services,
the better off they are as administrators - but if so, they're wrong;-)

Last I checked, I didn't think that draft had approached the right
balance. But I may be mis-remembering.

The "this" there isn't the same thing, and in any case I said "most
of this" - meaning "this" =3D=3D "the argument." I agree that strongly
attributable networking does not need to be ubiquitous to counter
attacks. However, I think it's likely true that defenders need in
some cases to be able to re-identify attackers (at least to the
level of categorising attack vs. kosher traffic) to mount effective
defenses, e.g. against (D)DoS. I figure it's that latter that makes
discussion of John's stated concerns moot. (Put another way - there
is no danger whatsoever that a rogue-HR-review would be taken
seriously if it made technically stupid recommendations or claimed
that technically necessary things "MUST NOT" be done. IMO, given
that isn't a danger, discussion of it as a danger is moot.)

Cheers,
S.

If one has been told that "the IETF has done a comprehensive review of a =
protocol for potential human rights impacts=E2=80=9D, then it is quite a =
reasonable expectation that human rights in the UDHR have been =
considered.  It may be that the rights contained therein aren=E2=80=99t =
impacted by the protocol in question or are impacted in a manner that is =
deemed reasonable given the consideration due other human rights, but =
some consideration is due if there are impacts.=20

If the group wants to restrict its analysis to a subset of rights in =
UDHR, or a specific set of human rights and interpretations contained =
elsewhere, that also seems reasonable, but probably shouldn=E2=80=99t be =
considered comprehensive, or promoted as such.  =20

For example, it is certainly possible to create perfectly functional =
protocols that provide for dynamic assignment and mapping of =
identifiers, and do not maintain logs or state that allows attribution =
of Internet actor at a later point in time.  Such a protocol would =
certainly have an impact on the human right to an effective remedy (for =
those who have their security violated by an Internet actor via such =
means) - regardless of the presence or absence of =E2=80=9Ceffective =
remedy=E2=80=9D in ICCPR.

i.e. it would probably be best to not reference the work of HT-rt as =
=E2=80=9Ca comprehensive analysis of the potential protocol impacts to =
human rights=E2=80=9D (as one cannot both be comprehensive and omit =
well-recognized human rights) but instead simply as an assessment of =
potential impacts to human rights noted in the International Covenant on =
Civil and Political Rights.=20

Hi Avri,

Looks good, some points:

It would be great to understand what Roya's talk would be about.

Also the chair could consider inviting/adding some of the other Canadian
thinkers and do-ers that are very active in the field of Internet
infrastructure and human rights, such as Lex Gill, Ron Deibert and and
the people from Deflect.ca.

Best,

Niels

Hi,

I can ask Ron and Lex today. I also did a pitch at the Citizen Lab
yesterday-- embedded in more general talk-- for folks to join the IETF.
Certainly some interest that I can follow up with next week.

Deflect/eQualitie are easy to reach because they're already in Montreal.
They could talk about Deflect, their bot hunting/forensic work,
censorship circumvention or even their multiparty chat protocol. What's
most interesting?

While it=E2=80=99s great to see error 451 being used, I would like to kno=
w if =

the folks on this list believe the message being displayed is factually =

correct. I say this as the term European Economic Area (EEA)  is the =

combination of countries that form part of the European Union and the =

European Free Trade Association (EFTA). Currently the GDPR is the =

law/regulation of the land in EU member countries.

Countries that form part of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) =

=E2=80=93 the regional trade organization and free trade area consisting =
of =

four European states: Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland =

=E2=80=93 have different processes to adopt EU regulations and may not ha=
ve =

yet adopted GDPR. That likely will occur soon,  but has is not the case =

yet.

/
https://www.inblf.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/GDPR-Norway.pdf


Might a possible correction be to simplify the message leaving out the =

geographical designation and instead state..  We recognize you are =

attempting to access this website from a country  which enforces the =

General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)..

No, it is as wrong as wrong can be. The website is not blocked because
of legal reasons; GDPR does not mandate blocking of any sort.

Actually this is just the most lazy way of copping out of corporate,
social and legal responsibilities imho.

Best,

GDPR does not mandate blocking, but it does require companies to
behave in various ways in order to conform to the law.  It seems that
in this case the operator of the site decided that the safest way to
conform was simply not to interact with anyone who is apparently
covered by the GDPR, and so they are refusing to talk to such people.
I don't see how that fails to meet the following description in RFC
7725, section 3:

   This status code indicates that the server is denying access to the
   resource as a consequence of a legal demand.

The description does not require a specific legal demand; neither does
it say that the legal demand need extend only to the content on the
website.

>From my point of view it's unfortunate that this is the way the
operator has chosen to proceed, but I don't see any way that 451 isn't
a correct code here.

Best regards,

I saw GoDaddy use 451 for sites/accounts that did not pay their bills -
so they did not live up to their contractual obligations under contract
law. Do you think such an interpretation would also be fitting?

It's a harder case to make, because in that case the legal demand is
not _on_ the operator, but instead coming _from_ the operator.  On the
other hand, the RFC does not make that distinction.  So I don't know.

Best regards,

It does fit better than another error code. And many more possible legal ties not yet identified. It is why, as a side note, that censorship circumvention and censorship monitoring technologists are not happy about 451 because it does not make their job of identifying government filtering/blocking/censorship easier but potentially even harder.

It looks like they have tried to twist reality to say that they're =
"blocking due to legal reasons" because of GDPR. However, the spec says =
451 is used "when a server operator has received a legal demand to deny =
access to a resource or to a set of resources that includes the =
requested resource." The legal demand in the case of GDPR is with =
regards to data handling, not access to resources.

Unfortunately, that description is in the Introduction of 7725, not the =
actual description of the status code.=20

Maybe, after some time and some real world experience, the spec could be revised to clarify which legal situations are fit for 451 and which are not - or there could be a best practice document explaining it. But then, there is no protocol police, so people who want to dump their own responsibilities onto some random government would still happily use 451.

Hi all,

A new version of draft-political, with a thorough revision of the
structure and some edits.

I made a clearer differentiation between the mapping of the different
positions on the political nature and outcome of technology and the IETF
standards process.

There is also a new abstract and a new conclusion which answers the
research question.

Looking forward to discuss! If there are comments, am happy to make a
new version before IETF102.

Best,

Niels

Abstract:
   The IETF cannot ordain which standards or protocols are to be used on
   network, but the standards developing process in the IETF has a
   normative effect.  Among other things the standardisation work at the
   IETF has implications on what is perceived as technologically
   possible and useful where networking technologies are being deployed,
   and its standards output reflect was is considered by the technical
   community as feasible and good practice.  Because mediates many
   aspects of modern life, and therefore contributes to the ordering of
   societies and communities, the consideration of the politics and
   (potential) impact of protocols should be part of the standardization
   and development process.




Please note that it may take a couple of minutes from the time of submission
until the htmlized version and diff are available at tools.ietf.org.

Dear folks

ISOC Switzerland (ISOC-CH) and the pEp Foundation with support of ISOC's
Beyond the Net has a project on Implementing Mass Encryption by
Standardizing pretty Easy privacy's protocols (pEp), which have as main
focus to achieve automatic privacy protection for messaging (e.g., email)=
=2E

However, in the course of the project we also run workshop series
throughout Switzerland -- they are called "Values of Internet
Technologies" (VIT):

  https://www.isoc.ch/archives/3017

The next topic will be:

  Human Rights and present / future ICT =E2=80=92 Why and how are they re=
lated?

Date: Sep 11

I think a perfect match would be if one or two of the main HRPC actors /
authors could come to Switzerland -- here Zurich -- to help us to set
the picture.

The event will be held at SWITCH, among other things authority for
=2Ech/li top-level domains.

What concerns past VIT events (there were already two workshops), see her=
e:

  https://pep.foundation/vit/

Also for the third workshop on Human Rights now, we would organize for
recordings and put them online.

Who would be interested?

Greets

Hernani

To be more precise here, first of all: everyone is welcome! :)

However, we're seeking for 1-2 persons specifically to provide input

Abstract

"Because mediates many"

Perhaps:
"Because it mediates many"


4.  Technology and Politics: a literature review

"Without judging them on their internal of external consistency they"

"of" -> "or"


4.3.  All protocols are political sometimes

"protocols can possible be predicted, on could at least consider the"

"on" -> "one"


4.4.  The network has its own logic and values

"This means that the network already contains constrains on what can be
deployed into it."

"constrains" -> "constraints"


7.  Conclusion

"undispited that standards and protocols are both product of a"

"undispited" -> "undisputed"

Dear Hernani

thank you for the reminder and the posting on the HRPC list.
I already put the meeting and registration on the ISOC.ch website
https://www.isoc.ch/events/human-rights-ict

We have Imai and Marcel from the new board who offered to help with the =
organization of the pEp Events
Can you please keep them up to date?

Imai offered to organize a remote location for the HR workshop in Geneva =
and engage HR experts from Geneva.

Daniel H=C3=BCrlimann a law Prof from The University St. Gallen, and =
ISOC.ch member offered to give a talk. Daniel H=C3=BCrlimann =
<daniel@huerlimann.com>

My question to all, how do we want to organize the meeting and who takes =
the lead?
I will support the meeting in Zurich, in our office but prefer if =
someone can take the oveall lead.

Thank you all,
best regards

Michael

That's not the problem I was describing. The problem I was trying to
get at is that anonymity is almost impossible, *technically*. For me,
that does not mean we ought give up and aim for a fully identified
network, rather the opposite - I figure we ought be figuring out how
to make less easily identifiable networking more usable, both for
people using network services and for people managing networks. (That
latter set of folks may currently disagree with me that the less they
have access to superfluous data related to people using their services,
the better off they are as administrators - but if so, they're wrong;-)

Last I checked, I didn't think that draft had approached the right
balance. But I may be mis-remembering.

The "this" there isn't the same thing, and in any case I said "most
of this" - meaning "this" =3D=3D "the argument." I agree that strongly
attributable networking does not need to be ubiquitous to counter
attacks. However, I think it's likely true that defenders need in
some cases to be able to re-identify attackers (at least to the
level of categorising attack vs. kosher traffic) to mount effective
defenses, e.g. against (D)DoS. I figure it's that latter that makes
discussion of John's stated concerns moot. (Put another way - there
is no danger whatsoever that a rogue-HR-review would be taken
seriously if it made technically stupid recommendations or claimed
that technically necessary things "MUST NOT" be done. IMO, given
that isn't a danger, discussion of it as a danger is moot.)

Cheers,
