Hiya,

See below for what might be an interesting case study relevant
to the ethics in networked systems thread. (NB: I say "might"
since I'm not familiar with the facts in this case but John's
analysis below seems convincing enough to at least indicate
that there're issues to consider here.)

If someone had the time and interest to analyse a case like
this, that could be a fine thing for the RG to document so that
folks participating in the IETF had an example of that kind of
analysis and could point to it if other participants were of
a mind to propose such features.

Apologies if this is a bit off-topic (I'm not sure being able
to use any USB charger rises to the level of being a human
right;-) but it seems to me like this might be a useful case
to look at more, partly as it's a bit simpler than others we
might see in the Internet.

S.

I love the concept of the new Power Delivery modes (100w of power, by
sending up to 20v at 5A over suitable cables).  If done right, I can
see people wiring their house and business wall outlets (and cars)
with much safer, more compact, and Internet-enabled USB-PD sockets,
replacing 110v or 220v wiring for a lot of uses.  Particularly in
places where the power source is DC anyway (like solar or cars) and/or
where they want data or video connectivity as well as power.

But I don't see how authentication fits in technically.  It looks like
it's there to build monopolies.

The alleged problem statement seems to be: Some expensive devices will
decline to spend the money to protect themselves from overvoltage or
overcurrent situations, thereby being damaged by out-of-spec power
supplies.  We need to authenticate chargers so this won't happen.
Let's examine this from an engineering point of view, then look at
the politics.

The One Laptop Per Child folks built their ~$100 laptops with power
inputs that accept 11 to 24 V usable, -32 to +40V tolerated without
damage.  This lets them be used with all kinds of janky third world
power, direct plug-ins to solar panels (the laptop does MPPT to
optimize charging direct from solar too), etc.  So it'll charge at +12
thru +24V, will decline to accept power at +35V or -12V or -24V but be
undamaged.  If you exceed this, e.g. by feeding 220V AC power to that
input by accident, it will blow an internal fuse that's easy for a
hardware tech to repair.  But that's a well designed yet cheap device.

Expensive USB3-PD devices could use similar circuitry to protect their
expensive devices from overvoltage or overcurrent.  Or, they could
spend years in standards committees designing authentication.  But I
don't see how the standards committee solves the problem.

Let's suppose that an expensive phone does USB3 authentication of its
putative power source and decides that the authentication FAILS.  Oh
my god, it's been attached to a "counterfeit" charger or a "defective"
cable!  How does it protect itself?

If it doesn't have circuitry that disconnects it from the power wires,
it will fry anyway.

But if it does have circuitry that disconnects it from the power
wires, why not trigger that disconnect based on measuring overvoltage or
overcurrent, rather than triggering it on failed authentication?

It seems to me that a counterfeit charger could short 110V down
the USB3 cable, with or without authentication.  What protects
the phone from that?

Similarly, what prevents a counterfeit charger from using a chip and a
flash image (including a signed certificate) that's identical to the
one in a certified, tested, approved, paid-up charger.  The
counterfeiter only has to clone that real chip one time, then they can
put it in all their products.  Or they could actually buy the real
chips on the open market, and just clone the firmware and the cert.
Yet their shoddy wiring, Grade Z external components, faulty housing,
etc, around that chip could still short 110V down the cable during the
wrong phase of the moon.  So the authentication will pass, but the
voltages and currents will at sudden times be dangerous.  I guess your
expensive phone will fry anyway, despite the crypto, because you
didn't spend 20c on protective components in the phone.

What am I missing here?  It looks like the alleged solution doesn't
solve the alleged problem.  Perhaps there's something else going on here.=


> The 'problem' is counterfeit chargers and defective
> cables that can and do damage expensive computers and phones.

"Can and do" is a misnomer here.  There are no counterfeit USB3-PD
chargers, because there are essentially no USB3-PD chargers on the
market yet.  I've been looking.  So there isn't a problem "yet"
from fake USB3-PD gear...

Perhaps you are talking about counterfeit USB2 chargers, that don't
even negotiate the voltage, just have resistor / capacitor networks
that signal the option to draw >500ma power at 5v?

Now let's look at the politics.

It is well understood in the consumer electronics industry how to use
authentication requirements to exert market power.  To be able to
build a peripheral devie that plugs into an iPhone, you have to
include a chip made only by Apple.  The phone won't talk to you
without having that chip in your thingy to answer a crypto challenge
sent by the iPhone.  Apple will only sell the chip to you if you give
them a significant part of the purchase price of the peripheral.  The
chip authentication is the technical hook that drives you to sign a
contract with Apple to become an "Apple Certified Peripheral".  There
are no "Apple uncertified peripherals" in the market, they don't sell
because they don't work, because Apple forces them to not work, using
Apple's control over the iPhone firmware to not let them work.  Didn't
you wonder why every iPhone dock and iPhone charger and iPhone cable
was vastly overpriced?  Even from a variety of competing third-party
manufacturers?  That's Apple raking in their 40% or whatever.  And if
your gadget competes too well against one of Apple's peripherals,
maybe they won't certify you at all.  Like the authentication-checking
on apps in the "app store": at any time, Apple can put you right out
of business, at their whim, and you have no recourse.

My initial suspicion is that THIS is what the USB3 "authentication"
spec is for.

A very similar scheme is the technical hook that forces you to sign a
contract to put DRM into your products in order to be able to make an
HDMI product that will interoperate with other HDMI products.  In that
case it isn't even to extract money for a single vendor -- it is to
exert market power on behalf of a group that doesn't even make devices
-- Hollywood.  They used business pressure ("negotiation") against
Intel to convince Intel to build this into the HDMI support in their
motherboards, to deny every competitor the ability to build products
that do things that consumers want but that Hollywood doesn't.

So just like the bastards who are trying to put DRM into the HTML
standards at the W3C, I suspect "someone" also trying to put DRM into
the USB standards.  This "USB Authentication" is the "hook" that means
you have to do whatever the "certification body" says you have to do.
Hey dj, who runs the org that will keep the master keys?  Or is that a
political issue that's conveniently outside the scope of the technical
USB Authentication specs?

Or will the certification be vendor-by-vendor, e.g. Apple devices will
look for a cert signed by key X, while Blu-Ray devices will look for a
cert signed by key Y?  How convenient -- a generic "hook" that ANY
vendor can use to make their USB products deliberately incompatible,
unless you enter into a one-sided coerced contract with them!  What a
sneaky way to undermine the intent of the "Universal" Serial Bus!

But never fear, it's all to prevent fried phones from those dastardly
"counterfeiters".  The leaders of our tech industry would NEVER use
this power for evil, only for good.

Hi,

I=E2=80=99ve read the thread on the Cryptography mailinglist also, and the c=
urrent conclusion there seems to be that it is very unclear what the purpose=
 of the crypto would be in the USB3 standard.

Summarising:
- News articles and the standard are claiming to use crypto in USB3 for clai=
ms regarding power capabilities in devices and cables.
- If you want to stop power transfer while checking crypto claims, you will n=
eed to put in circuitry to control power transfer.
- If you=E2=80=99re putting in circuitry to control power transfer, it is pr=
obably cheaper to add circuitry to verify actual power capabilities than it i=
s to include crypto circuitry.
- With current devices it may still be necessary to check power capabilities=
 anyway, as simple crypto chips can currently be easily cloned.

So things are not looking good for this idea, and that=E2=80=99s even withou=
t looking at the ethics :)

Jeroen.

Hi Avri,

We're working hard on resolving some of these questions and making a big
review. Much of the work can be followed in realtime here:
https://github.com/nllz/IRTF-HRPC/blob/master/draft-research.md

Some replies inline to your email while I was drafting:

Will take this into account while re-writing. I am also trying to focus
on which behavior a protocol allows and disallows (or even stimulates).
I think that is inherent part of the protocols

IP is also a protocol, right?

Not sure if it is either/or.

Have been thinking about this and having a hard time coming up with a
clear difference between the two. Would you have suggestions that can
help us further?

>=20

Will try to add more concrete protocol examples, but I think there are
also a lot of examples that show how protocol design allows for misuse,
I think that should also be addressed at protocol level (as for instance
done in html2)

Hi Joe,

Sorry for the delay, there were some building issues, and as you know
kramdown-rfc2629 is not always as verbose as one wants to be :)

Please find a new version here:
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-tenoever-hrpc-research/

Comment and questions on the list, suggestions also very much welcome as
pull requests here (preferably with a short describption in a mail to
the list):

I have been a silent subscriber of the mailing list for some time, having
read the Internet drafts published recently I thought it would be good to
forward one item that can provide a new dimension to the ongoing work. It
has been repeatedly said that access to the Internet is becoming more and
more a human right issue- I feel the working group approach need to be
beyond the protection of freedom of speech, as it has tried to be to an
extent in the case of making the Internet environment accessible for people
with disability. The large chunks of population in developing countries or
countries in the global south are disconnected and the accessibility issue
also need to be one of the targets in the design of a protocol that
addresses human rights related issue.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in a legible manner.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; These are some general comments<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>

there is very<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Will take this into account while re-writing. I am also tr=

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on which behavior a protocol allows and disallows (or even=

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think that is inherent part of the protocols<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>

<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; IP is also a protocol, right?<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In a sense they<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; seem to be larger architectural issues (also a part of=
 the RG&#39;s work) as<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; opposed to protocol issues.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Not sure if it is either/or.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But they are not broken out that way.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Might be worth differentiating between the architectur=
al issues and the<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; protocol issues.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Have been thinking about this and having a hard time comin=
g up with a<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; clear difference between the two. Would you have suggestio=
ns that can<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; help us further?<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - Much on the comment of the protocols is more about h=
ow people can<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; misuse the protocols and not abut protocol elements th=
at enable bad or<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; good behavior.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - also, so much of the discussion seems to circle arou=

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - I think the discussion needs to take some of the wor=

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - I think the consideration questions at the end are g=

Dear Dessalegn,

Thank you for your email. I think in the draft [0] we have been focusing
on topics that go beyond freedom of speech, for instance where we looked
at freedom of association, non-discrimination, equal protection,
political participation, participation in cultural life, arts and
science and the right to security.

As you say, connectivity is an inherent part of freedom as expression,
and that is also how it is defined in the draft. But I am afraid that
providing access to the Internet is not a protocol issue where is comes
to providing the actual connection and providing bandwith (please
correct me if I'm wrong!). Therefore I think it is outside of the
purview of this document and research group.

We do however have explicit references to usage of protocols on low
bandwith, high latency connections, have for instance a look at
'5.3.2.1.11.  Accessibility' and '5.3.2.1.14.  Reliability'.

Always happy to discuss.

All the best,

Niels

Thank you Niel for the reply. I understand there are elements of the
connectivity issue that cannot be solved technically. What I tried to
points out in my previous e-mail is that making protocol adaptive to the
various types of challenges that characterize the telecommunication
infrastructure of developing countries is another dimension the work need
to consider- connectivity being too often intermittent, slowness or
bandwidth is too low, etc. Accessibility in its truest sense also need to
consider users quality of experience which is not the case for most
developing countries due to the factors mentioned earlier.  I would also
suggest resource sharing like traffic peering and others to be treated in
the manner other factors are being considered- it potentially  enhances
accessibility .

Best,
Dessalegn

cess<br>Dear Dessalegn,<br>
<br>
Thank you for your email. I think in the draft [0] we have been focusing<br=
>
on topics that go beyond freedom of speech, for instance where we looked<br=
>
at freedom of association, non-discrimination, equal protection,<br>
political participation, participation in cultural life, arts and<br>
science and the right to security.<br>
<br>
As you say, connectivity is an inherent part of freedom as expression,<br>
and that is also how it is defined in the draft. But I am afraid that<br>
providing access to the Internet is not a protocol issue where is comes<br>
to providing the actual connection and providing bandwith (please<br>
correct me if I&#39;m wrong!). Therefore I think it is outside of the<br>
purview of this document and research group.<br>
<br>
We do however have explicit references to usage of protocols on low<br>
bandwith, high latency connections, have for instance a look at<br>
&#39;5.3.2.1.11.=C2=A0 Accessibility&#39; and &#39;5.3.2.1.14.=C2=A0 Reliab=
ility&#39;.<br>
<br>
Always happy to discuss.<br>
<br>
All the best,<br>
<br>
Niels<br>

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on which behavior a protocol allow=

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; little discussion of proto=

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0to focus<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on which behavior a protocol a=

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think that is inherent part =

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; DST) than to elements of t=

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; seem to be larger architec=

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Might be worth differentia=

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - I think the discussion n=

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0is going<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; into protecting these prot=
ocols into account (e.g. HTTP -&gt;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0HTTPS). The<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; draft did this for P2P but=
 not for many of other discussions.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Working on it.<br>

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - much of the discussion f=
ocuses on privacy elements, which<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0are already<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; covered and not on other a=
spects of FoE and FoA.=C2=A0 Ie.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0something is a<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; problem because the lack o=

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0This is<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; good point, but is it spec=

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I am not sure I see how th=

Hey Corrine, Niels,

I have been reading though your recent draft =
<https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-tenoever-hrpc-research/>=C2=A0 =
<https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-tenoever-hrpc-research/>on =
protocol considerations. There were a couple of things I couldn=E2=80=99t =
figure out from the text that I was hoping you might be able to clarify.=20=


Firstly, what specific relationship is the visual equation (of =
architectural features to rights) intended to imply? =20

	eg. (  Connectivity )
   (      Privacy                )
   (      Security               )   =3D Right to freedom of expression
   (      Content agnosticism    )
   (      Internationalization   )
   (      Censorship resistance  )
   (      Open Standards         )
    (     Heterogeneity support )

Is it intended to imply that no other architectural feature bears upon =
that right? Or, is it intended to imply that ALL of the listed =
architectural features MUST be present in order for the right to be =
protected? And If not all, then how many features need not be present =
before a protocol can be considered to abrogate a right?
=09
Secondly, what method/principals have you used to determine which rights =
are affected by which architectural features (technical concepts)? I was =
expecting an explanation of this in section 5.2.2 of the methodology but =
I can=E2=80=99t seem to find one there or elsewhere in the doc. Have I =
missed this somewhere?

Many thanks, and great work!

Scott

Hey Corrine, Niels,

I have been reading though your recent draft =
<https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-tenoever-hrpc-research/>=C2=A0 =
<https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-tenoever-hrpc-research/>on =
protocol considerations. There were a couple of things I couldn=E2=80=99t =
figure out from the text that I was hoping you might be able to clarify.=20=


Firstly, what specific relationship is the visual equation (of =
architectural features to rights) intended to imply? =20

	eg. (  Connectivity )
   (      Privacy                )
   (      Security               )   =3D Right to freedom of expression
   (      Content agnosticism    )
   (      Internationalization   )
   (      Censorship resistance  )
   (      Open Standards         )
    (     Heterogeneity support )

Is it intended to imply that no other architectural feature bears upon =
that right? Or, is it intended to imply that ALL of the listed =
architectural features MUST be present in order for the right to be =
protected? And If not all, then how many need not be present before a =
protocol can be considered to abrogate a right?
=09
Secondly, what method/principals have you used to determine which rights =
are affected by which architectural features (technical concepts)? I =
expected to see an explanation of this in section 5.2.2 of the =
methodology but t I couldn't seem to find one there or elsewhere in the =
doc. Have I missed this somewhere?

Many thanks, and great work!

Scott

Dear all,

There is a new version of the research document.

This document addresses:
- The comments made at the mic at the hrpc in Buenos Aires at IETF95
- The comments made by Avri [0]
- The suggestions made by Nick Doty to revise the questionnaire in line
with the W3C privacy and security questionnaire [1]
- Improvements after a full re-read by Corinne and me.

I think with this all outstanding issues in the draft have been
addresses and we're feeling pretty confident about the maturity of the
document. But it is of course always good to hear your ideas,
suggestions and comments.

Best,

Niels

A new version of I-D, draft-tenoever-hrpc-research-02.txt
has been successfully submitted by Niels ten Oever and posted to the
IETF repository.

Name:		draft-tenoever-hrpc-research
Revision:	02
Title:		Research into Human Rights Protocol Considerations
Document date:	2016-05-13
Group:		Individual Submission
Pages:		67

Abstract:
   The increaseing convolution of Internet and society increases the
   impact of the Internet on the lives of individuals.  Because of this,
   the design and development of the architecture of the Internet also
   has an increasing impact on society.  This has led to an increasing
   recognition that human rights [UDHR] [ICCPR] [ICESCR] have a role in
   the development and management of the Internet [HRC2012] [UNGA2013]
   [NETmundial].  It has also been argued that the Internet should be
   strengthened as a human rights enabling environment [Brown].

   This document provides a proposal for a vocabulary to discuss the
   relation between human rights and Internet protocols, an overview of
   the discussion in technical and academic literature and communities,
   a proposal for the mapping of the relation between human rights and
   technical concepts, and a proposal for guidelines for human rights
   considerations, similar to the work done on the guidelines for
   privacy considerations [RFC6973].

   Discussion of this draft at: hrpc@irtf.org //

Please note that it may take a couple of minutes from the time of submiss=
ion
until the htmlized version and diff are available at tools.ietf.org.

Hi Niels,

I sent an email earlier today to the list with some feedback. However,
because I sent it by my work email (which isn't subscribed) as opposed to
my own email (which is subscribed) it went to the moderator (you) for
approval.

Has that come through to you, or should I resend the feedback?

Thanks,

Scott

Hi Scott,

Thanks for your question. The relationship that is implied (and I think
it is in the text, if not I should definitely add it), that these
concepts shape the enabling environment on the Internet for exercising a
specific right.

That does not mean that we could not imagine another Internet without
these properties where these rights could also be exercised, but in the
current Internet we think these are the crucial ingredient for enabling
the ability to exercise specific rights.

How we came to this is described in step 5.2.1.4.  Translating Human
Rights Concept into Technical Definitions

Hope this helps, and looking forward to discuss!

Best,

Niels

PS If you think this is not clear from the text, please say so (or even
better, create a pull request here:

Dear RG,



This email serves as a call for RG adoption of
draft-tenoever-hrpc-research-02 [0] as a RG document. The call for
adoption will run for 2 weeks ending 5/30/2016.



Several of your might have thought this document was already an RG
document, but since it was never formally adopted we thought it might be
a good idea to do that now (even though this is not strictly a
requirement for this in the IRTF, but for the sake of clarity and
transparency we'll follow the IETF procedure as decribed in RFC7221).



Please note that this is a call for adoption, and not a last call for
content of the document. Adopting a RG document simply means that the RG
will focus its efforts on that particular draft going forward, and use
that document for resolving open issues and documenting the RG=E2=80=99s =
decisions.



Please indicate whether you support adoption or not, and if not why.
Issues you have with the current document itself can also be raised, but
they should be raised in the context of what should be changed in the
document going forward, rather than a pre-condition for adoption.



Looking forward to hear your opinions.



All the best,



Niels

Hi Niels,=20

Thanks for the answer. I had another look through section 5.2.1.4. and I =
couldn't find a description of the test you have applied to determine =
whether an architectural feature is a 'crucial ingredient for enabling =
the ability to exercise specific rights=92 (and therefore qualified for =
inclusion in the equation below.)=20


>> eg. (  Connectivity )
>>=20
>>   (      Privacy                )
>>   (      Security               )   =3D Right to freedom of =
expression
>>   (      Content agnosticism    )
>>   (      Internationalization   )
>>   (      Censorship resistance  )
>>   (      Open Standards         )
>>    (     Heterogeneity support )


Say, for example, that someone were to claim that a feature (or =
combination of features) that you have listed as 'shaping the enabling =
environment' for freedom of expression did not do so. What criteria =
would be used to assess the merits of that claim? Is there a specific =
test that was applied during the creation of the second list (see =
quotation below) which could be examined? (this is what I=92ve been =
trying to find).

>> Mapping the protocols and standards that are related to human rights =
and create a human rights enabeling environment was the first step. For =
that we needed to focus on specific technical concepts that underlie =
these protocols and  standards. On the basis of this list a number of =
technical concepts that appeared frequently was extracted, and used to =
create a second list of technical terms that, when combined, create an =
enabling environment for excercising human rights on the Internet.=20


If no test was used, then I would argue it would be highly beneficial to =
develop one. A test would, I think, aid in ensuring the kind of clear, =
explicit and Human Rights conscious design decisions you describe below =
.=20

>  It is however important to make consicious and explicit design =
decisions that take into account the human rights protocol =
considerations guidelines developed below. This will ensure that the =
impact protocols can have on human rights is clear and explicit, both =
for developers and for users.


I'm therefore tentatively proposing two possibilities (based on UK =
Judicial Review principals) for discussion:

1. Inevitability test (The stricter standard)

An architectural feature does not impinge upon a right unless a =
violation of the right in question would not be possible but for the =
inclusion (or absence) of that feature acting alone or in combination =
with at least one other feature.=20


2. Highly Likely test (The weaker standard)

An architectural feature does not impinge upon a right unless the =
probability of the right in question being violated would be =
substantially different as a result of the presence (or absence) of that =
feature acting alone or in combination with at least one other feature

Hi,

I personally think it might be premature for this call, but since it has
been made, would like to know of people who read this draft and think
that it is something that is ready to become a RG draft.

Is anyone willing to review this with a light to making a recommendation
on whether it should be a RG work item?  Would like to get some deeper
opinion on the draft and its contents, especially from an engineering
perspective.

I would also like to hear about others who are interested in working on
this draft, as becoming an RG draft means moving it more into the main
work stream of the RG and getting greater input that just the authors
and a few commenters.

I have not had a chance to read it yet, but will do so as soon as I can.

avri

Hi Scott,

Thanks again for your comments.

Our methodology to determine whether an architectural feature is a 'crucial
ingredient for enabling the ability to exercise specific rights' is based
on several steps which you mentioned.

The meta-approach of linking certain technical properties to certain social
outcomes is based on the work done by Clark (1988) who explains the
relation between the design goals and the features of the protocols. And
that of Abbate (2000) and  Denardis (2013,2014) who explain how social
values, and the personal values of engineers enter into the Internet's
architecture, creating technology that elevates certain social values.

We argue that many of the technical features of the current Internet, like
the crucial features mentioned by Clark (1988) (interoperability,
redundancy, end-to-end etc), fundamentally enable human rights. In order to
establish this we have compared the different properties of human rights to
technical properties of protocols, and also gave multiple examples of cases
where the presence of certain technological features objectively undermine
or enable human rights (like injection of records, traffic interception,
XMPP). It is on the basis of these various case studies, elaborate
discussion on the mailinglist and at various IETF conferences that we came
to determine whether an architectural feature is a 'crucial ingredient for
enabling the ability to exercise specific rights=E2=80=99.

I think we might need to specify that by enabling human rights we do not
assume that if these features are present the realization of human rights
automatically follows suit. Or in other words, these features are necessary
but not sufficient. As we both know, for instance with freedom of
expression, if you have an open, accessible free Internet on a protocol
level but a government blocks access to it or filters for certain content
you do not have freedom of expression in the fullest sense.

The approach we take suggests that the relationship between technical
properties and human rights should be approached as a continuum, where
certain technical properties allow for human rights to be enabled to
different extends. The relationship between the presence of certain legal
principles for enabling human rights on the other hand is much more black
or white.

For example, the Internet can still enable freedom of expression when there
is connectivity (even though the end-users runs a greater risk than when
the technical properties of connectivity and privacy and security are also
present) but freedom of expression (as defined in the UDHR) cannot be fully
guaranteed when, for instance, people can seek and receive information but
not impart it.

As such I think it would be interesting to take up your suggestion and work
out a way to use the
"Highly Likely test", to define which features have what impact on human
rights. However, at the same time I am unsure if a legal test is the best
way to go about it. The potential impact of legal principles being present
or absent has a much clearer impact on for instance human rights like
freedom of expression, than does the presence or absence of certain
technical principles.

I would love to hear what you think!

Best,

Hmm, I'm not sure why this would be premature, Avri. It seems like a
core document this group would work on in addition to methodology and
glossary.

We have a large quantity of comments on this draft (working with our
fellow, Scott Craig) that we'll be sharing in coming weeks.

We support adoption. best, Joe

Thanks, Niels!

So, from the text in 5.2.1.4, would you say that the bracketed list of
concepts/ingredients/properties serves as "a list of technical
concepts that when combined create an enabling environment for [a
specific] human right"?

It would be good to make sure we've interrogated, as a group, each of
the technical concepts in the LHS of these equations. E.g., while I'm
a privacy guy to the core, I suspect something more precise like
confidentiality is the underlying technical concept?

best, Joe

Hi Joe,

Great note! I have replied to some of these points in another thread where
I address Scott's comments. I think its titled "What test determines
whether an architectural feature is a crucial ingredient for enabling the
ability to exercise specific right?"

 Could you perhaps check if that thread already addresses some of the
points you made here?

Happy to further discuss,

Best, Corinne

So, from the text in 5.2.1.4, would you say that the bracketed list of<br>
concepts/ingredients/properties serves as &quot;a list of technical<br>
concepts that when combined create an enabling environment for [a<br>

It would be good to make sure we&#39;ve interrogated, as a group, each of<b=

Hey Corrine,=20

That=E2=80=99s awesome, thanks for the explanation.

To clarify, the aim of the test I=E2=80=99m proposing is not about =
introducing any kind legal determination. Its purpose is to:

(1) Set a cut-off point on the continuum you describe (above which the =
effect of an architectural feature on a right can be considered to be =
material) =20
(2) Constrain the authors=E2=80=99 scope of judgement (minimising =
potential bias)

I think the method you have described (quoted below) is great for =
identifying candidate features. But my concern is that it=E2=80=99s =
insufficient to determine that a candidate feature is an enabling (or =
restricting) feature.=20

" It is on the basis of these various case studies, elaborate discussion =
on the mailinglist and at various IETF conferences that we came to =
determine whether an architectural feature is a 'crucial ingredient for =
enabling the ability to exercise specific rights=E2=80=99. "

If no explicit test is applied to the candidate features after =
identification, I think this causes three problems:

(1) Judgements are arbitrary   =20
i.e there is no basis on which to argue that the threshold for inclusion =
was the same for one technical concept as for another.=20

(2) Judgements are not replicable.=20
i.e it is not possible to claim that different authors would not have =
come to significantly different conclusions than you have.

(4) Judgements cannot be contested =20
e.g if someone were to disagree with your contention that =
internationalisation has a bearing on the Right to political =
participation, on what basis would we adjudicate who is correct?


I would agree that the impact of a feature on a right will lie somewhere =
on a continuum. And perhaps deciding not to have a cut off threshold =
might actually be attractive (because it would allow us, when =
convenient, to claim that any feature has a bearing on rights).

However, the issue with the idea of a continuum is that there will =
always be a cut of point somewhere (for what is or is not included in =
the guidance). It would be much better that the point be based on some =
verifiable test than be arbitrary.  =20

As the time available for protocol designers to consider HR is always =
going to be limited, I would argue that there is a need to demonstrate =
that a feature crosses some threshold of effect in order to justify the =
kind of extra consideration by protocol designers that the document =
proposes.

The alternative would be to accept that, since every feature could be =
said to affect rights to some degree, every feature would have some =
cause to be considered to some extent by a protocol designer. This would =
make it much harder to argue that a protocol designer should give more =
consideration to the features contained in the guidance than those not =
outside it - potentially making the argument for producing such guidance =
void.=20

Hope this makes sense!

I might not be your ideal base for this request since I have solely lurked =
on this list from early on, out of professional interest as a network resea=
rcher, and since I have not previously been involved in the IRTF process. H=
owever, I would be willing to provide sustained feedback and comment from t=
hat position of independence from the process thus far, and have a meaningf=
ul history of research and publication on the underlying mechanisms associa=
ted with the proposal =96 although I suspect that anything that Mr. Bortzme=
yer is involved in will be quite technically solid in that respect. If anyt=
hing, from my current read, the draft requires a bit of copyediting and som=
e further degree of interrogation in order ensure clarity and to extend the=
 premise in certain areas, but I think those are a product of the document'=
s ambition and not a sign of immaturity.=20

So, I would be happy to provide outside assistance and critiques based on m=
y professional and research involvements for the document proposed for adop=
tion as RG draft.=20

Cordially,
Collin Anderson

Hmm, I'm not sure why this would be premature, Avri. It seems like a
core document this group would work on in addition to methodology and
glossary.

We have a large quantity of comments on this draft (working with our
fellow, Scott Craig) that we'll be sharing in coming weeks.

We support adoption. best, Joe

Dear Roland,

I hope this email find you well.

Thank you for sharing this paper it is very interesting. Upon reading it I
had the following questions:

- Do you believe that it might be interesting to also include the Ruggie
principles in your discussion of human rights in paragraph 2.1?

- "However, unlike physical measurements the theoretical knowledge required
for establishing valid quantified measurements of moral values in general
[22] and values of human rights in particular does not exist
=E2=80=8B." =E2=80=8BAlthough I agree that it is difficult to establish qua=
ntifiers for
measuring moral values there exist legal tests to quantify if certain human
rights standards are being met, which you yourself reference in the paper.
As such the sentence above reads a little confusing, could you clarify what
you mean?

- Do you believe it is really unknown what values lie behind protocols? I
think Denardis, Abbate and several others have done a decent job describing
that both the social, ethical values of individual engineers and the
commercial values of the companies they work become reflected in the
technology they design.

-  "Although the juridical legitimacy of the IETF to enforce human rights
by technical means might be questionable [4], rationales for responsibility
of the IETF may stem from Art. 28 UDHR providing the right to an
international or- der in which human rights can be realized. This claim is
directed to global institutional actors [29]. In governance ar- eas where
governments are absent or play a minor role, this claim affects the de
facto governing actors, i.e., the IET."
This is an interesting line of argumentation, do you plan to expand on it
in your research?

- In your conclusion you cover a lot of very relevant and broader
questions, I was wondering if you have considered adding a short bit about
the tension that exist in the debate on human rights and to what extend
they are universal, and more particularly who gets to decide which values
will be realized through protocols and why.

Overall it is a great article, it really lays out the issues in structured
and succinct way. Great to see the work of the HRPC group mentioned as well=
. I
was wondering what the time line is for you moving forward on this research=
?

Best,

Corinne

However, I would be willing to provide sustained feedback and comment from that position of independence from the process thus far, and have a meaningful history of research and publication on the underlying mechanisms associated with the proposal  although I suspect that anything that Mr. Bortzmeyer is involved in will be quite technically solid in that respect. If anything, from my current read, the draft requires a bit of copyediting and some further degree of interrogation in order ensure clarity and to extend the premise in certain areas, but I think those are a product of the document's ambition and not a sign of immaturity.

I followed the group from the start (even if I did not participate)
and I've read this draft (seriousy, I believe).

I support the adoption by the RG. It is both useful and well-written
(frankly, because of the novelty and difficulty of the project, I was
skeptical at the beginning). I hope I will be able to act as a
reviewer/etc.

I do not say I fully agree with the current version. For instance,
what is written about mobility and multicasting is [censored by myself
because my son, looking over my shoulder, tells me I'm too harsh].

Some details:

* is it really useful to mention Netmundial? Is it something else than
one of the many diplomatic meetings of the governance circus?

* there are still some self-contradiction in the draft. For instance,
5.2.4 starts by saying that, unlike ccTLD, .com does not impose limits
on free speech and, later on, 5.2.4.1 rightly notes that .com is NOT
floating above governments and states, it is a USA ccTLD.

Thanks for this.

With a lot of interest I have been following the discussion at
ietf@ietf.org about the IETF100 location, for which the IAOC selected
Singapore, and which was strongly questioned by Ted Hardie at in Buenos
Aires at the plenary.

I do not want to replicate that discussion here, but at several points
it was brought up that the human rights situation in a specific country
might be reason to not have a meeting there.

I think this is something that deserves discussion here, and if we
manage to come to a approach, we could suggest integration of that in
this draft:
https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-baker-mtgvenue-iaoc-venue-selection-pro=
cess-02

Curious to hear what you all think.

Best,

Niels

Folks -=20

A most excellent document - one that is definitely necessary since the =
properties
cyberspace is sufficiently different from real-world space to make the =
mapping of=20
basic human rights a nontrivial exercise.

Given that the document aims to be "a proposal for the mapping of the =
relation=20
between human rights and technical concepts=E2=80=9D, has any =
consideration been given=20
to UNDHR article 8, and how we go about mapping it to technical =
concepts?

Niels,

Thanks for raising the issue.

In the last two years two ICANN meetings were held in Singapore (ICANN =

49&52). Was that an issue then? Would it be an issue in the future with =

=E2=80=9Chuman rights=E2=80=9D in the fundamental bylaws? As well, what w=
here the =

considerations when ICANN 46 was being planned in Beijing?

Should the same criteria also be advanced at the RIR? For instance, =

LACNIC just held its latest meeting in Havana, Cuba. Given the country =

scores at the bottom of most rankings, should meetings in the future not =

be planned there until there=E2=80=99s a considerable improvement in huma=
n =

rights condition in the country?



Regards

Robert

Hi folks

Just that there is a controversy and that it's being written about is a
very good thing.

I'm not sure if this was intentional by either side, but narrowing the
options to address this clear political problem in Singapore to a single
tactic, namely to host or not to host, makes it really difficult to
leverage the discussion in other ways.

What if instead we were prepared to host in Singapore and deliver a
statement to the government? Host a press conference? Or on the action
side: for Ted Hardie and others with him and/or in solidarity with
him/them bring their partners in defiance of the laws (albeit as
privileged foreigners). Probably there are other tactics. So the logic
is that pulling out of the event hurts them economically, then perhaps
we can think of that money as buying an audience in Singapore.

I agree that we should join the discussion with an approach.

-Mallory

ICANN 60 will be held in Abu Dhabi . Does this group and others wish
to raise any human rights concerns in regards to having the meeting
held in the UAE

I think some calm, considered discussion here would be good if
we have folks on this list with HR expertise, which I hope we do.
One of the issues with such discussions on ietf@ietf.org is that a
lot of us think we know a lot about stuff when we might not (me
included;-) Improving on that would be good. As you say though,
just repeating what's already been a pretty verbose discussion
is unlikely to be helpful, so I really hope we don't do that.

I'd not worry for now about what document might end up with
what text - it's too early to say IMO.

Cheers,
S.

Let's not come to rapid conclusions. Let's first see what different
criteria there are (having meetings in different parts of the world also
being one as clearly outlined here:
https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-baker-mtgvenue-iaoc-venue-selection-pro=
cess-02
) and when we have different criteria that are important we can
prioritize them and develop a method of weighing them.

And let's first keep this to the IETF, and when we work it out here, we
can think of other fora.

Best,

Niels

Why does it deserve discussion _here_?  This RG is supposed to be
about protocol considerations, not meetings and not human rights in
general.

There is a list where people are discussing the venue selection, and I
think that if people want human rights considerations to be brought to
bear on that discussion they should go join that list and try to make
sure those considerations are in fact brought to bear.  But if we have
this discussion in every list that the IETF or IRTF hosts where the
venue selection could possibly be relevant to the list (i.e. all of
them), it will never converge.

Best regards,

A

Hi Andrew,

The Charter of the group is to 'research whether standards and protocols
can enable, strengthen or threaten human rights, as defined in the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and the International Covenant
on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)

A significant aspect of the investigation into whether standards and
protocols enable, strengthen or threaten human rights concerns has been the
means and mechanisms through which protocols are developed.

Niels proposal that we investigate the degree of consideration, or lack
thereof, given to the Human Rights in the choice of location venue seems
well within the scope of the matter being investigated by the group.

Regards,

Scott Craig

Hi John,

Are you referring to:

Article 8
Everyone has the right to an effective remedy by the competent national
tribunals for acts violating the fundamental rights granted him by the
constitution or by law.

If so, does this mean that your question could be reformulated as:
'Have you already resolved the Internet and jurisidition problem?'

If this is the case, my answer would be: we're working with human rights
because this is the most universal standard that we've got, exactly to
not go down the rabbit hole of different situations in different
jurisdictions.

Does this help?

Best,

Niels

H Niels,

A couple of thoughts on the venue selection process

https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-baker-mtgvenue-iaoc-venue-selection-process-02#section-3
 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-baker-mtgvenue-iaoc-venue-selection-process-02#section-3>
 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-baker-mtgvenue-iaoc-venue-selection-process-02#section-3>



*1. Can it be established whether or not the IETF considers Human
Rights to be 'political criteria'. *


Political considerations:
      The IETF does not make political statements.  We do not decide who
      is or is not a country, and we do not choose or not choose venues
      based on political criteria.


*2. Can it be established whether or not the IETF formally considered
its 'principal of inclusiveness' in previous venue selections.*
Inclusiveness:

      We *would like* to facilitate the onsite or remote participation of
      anyone who wants to be involved.  Every country has limits on who
      it will permit within its borders.  *This principle of
      inclusiveness militates against the selection of venues within
      countries that impose visa regulations and/or laws that
      effectively exclude people on the basis of race, religion, gender,
      sexual orientation, or national origin,* and to a lesser extent,
      *reduces the likelihood* of selecting countries that use such
      attributes to make entry difficult.

Scott,

If it=E2=80=99s not too late, might I propose a suggested revision to the=
 =

paragraph so that it is consistent with language terms used in  UN =

processes, such as the ongoing Habitat III negotiations

http://mirror.unhabitat.org/categories.asp?catid=3D831

Below is a suggested revision of the paragraph.



We *would like* to facilitate the onsite or remote participation of =

inclusive and free from any form of discrimination, based on gender, =

age, health status, disability, income, nationality, ethnicity, =

migratory condition, or political, religious or sexual orientation , =

where all inhabitants, whether permanent or transitional, are granted =

equal rights and opportunities, according to the United Nations Charter =

principles and the relevant provisions of international law.


This paragraph might be missing certain aspects of the original =

paragraph. Do add them back in :)

regards

Robert

Scott,

Ill defer to you and Niels on ways it might be possible to have my 
suggested language make its way to the IETF for consideration :)

Yes.

No, that is not a correct reformulation of my question.

There are already existing processes in the real world for pursuit of =

My question is far simpler:

There is no reason to consider different jurisdictions, nor is that our =
job.
However, whether IETF protocols facilitate or obscure information needed
in the determination of the relevant jurisdiction(s) and thus support =
the
human right of effective remedy/due process is definitely a valid =
question.

This is simply the question of whether someone=E2=80=99s basic right to =
be able to
initiating legal recourse is or is not not pre-empted via IETF design =
decisions
made during protocol development.  You may perhaps consider that out of
scope for your initial effort (i.e. left for future work or simply a =
human right
not to be protected on the Internet) but then there should be included =
some
form of statement to that effect.

There has been extensive work in mapping UN Declaration of Human
Rights to the online context, and this includes recent efforts =
(including
the Dynamic Coalition on human rights meeting at IGF) let to a nice
statement on same - =E2=80=9CThe Charter of human rights and principles =
for
the internet=E2=80=9D - <http://internetrightsandprinciples.org/site/ =
<http://internetrightsandprinciples.org/site/>>   It might
be worth looking at this document, as it already has similar mappings
of the various human rights into the online context and made provide
an additional basis for this effort.

Thanks!

Hey Robert,

The paragraphs aren't mine, they are cited are from the IETF's guidance doc
linked above. Sorry that wasn't clear. The questions above them are issues
I think they raise.

Good suggestion though!

Scott

Hi,

> draft-tenoever-hrpc-research-02 [0] as a RG document. The call for

I had asked:

The period ended yesterday.  We have had reviews and we have had
commitments to work on it further.  I would like to see more reviews and
more commitments to read and work on it, but at this point am satisfied
that it is more than just a couple of people who have done some serious
reading and thinking on the draft.

=46rom the email I have seen on the list, including from those who read
and reviewed I would say that we have RG support for making this an RG
document.  I have seen several people indicate that it should be an RG
doc and did not see  anyone say it shouldn't be.

If anyone disagrees with this assessment, please let the list know in
the very near future.

Personally, I finished reading it yesterday and while I have not written
up any notes yet - will real soon now, I think it is now a strong draft
and while I think it will benefit from further work, think it is a an
I-D that serves the HRPC RG effort and ongoing work well.

My suggestion would be that comments on the current draft  continue for
another couple of weeks and that the authors plan on putting out the RG
draft in time for the Berlin meeting.  I also suggest that the two
current authors remain the co-authors for the RG draft.

Thanks to those who participated in this call.

avri
