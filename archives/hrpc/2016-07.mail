Hi Scott,

I have been thinking a lot about your suggestions. I think the test you
have been proposing might not be applicable for a technical environment
(but am happy to be proven wrong).

I do not think we can exhaustively list and map the risks that protocols
generate in relation to rights.

I would also like to add that the test you propose is neither part nor a
requirement in for instance security considerations:
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2223#section-9
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3552

Similar to the guidelines on security considerations RFC3552 and the
guidelines on privacy considerations RFC6973 we've proposed vectors of
analysis and provided examples.

That these vectors might not be exhaustive and always context dependent
are for me no arguments to hold the draft back.

Furthermore I think the guidelines provide an input for discussion of
drafts during drafting phase, but also when they're discussed for review
in other WGs or later on in the IESG. Decisions and reviews are
documented (and arguments are provided), so I am not sure whether one
can say the standpoints are arbitrary, nor that the judgments are not
replicable or cannot be contested (there are processes for that, that
can get weighed by the appropriate groups). It is not like these
guidelines for considerations are applied blindly.

If I understood you incorrectly, could you perhaps illustrate the test a
bit more in the specific case of security considerations?

Best,

Niels

Hey Niels,

Thanks for this.

The fundamental issue I have is that the method you have used to claim
links between features and rights is a black box. There is no discernible
basis for the links other than your own judgement.

I don=E2=80=99t in any way doubt the quality of your judgement. But I strug=
gle to
see how it provides sufficient grounds on which to expect every IETF
engineer to pay additional attention to the features in the document.

The idea of a test was simply a way to add some rigour to these claims in
order to give them some means of defence if they are challenged and some
means of adjudication if they are disputed.  Right now you are literally
just saying that you talked to some people and then you decided which
things were linked.

" It is on the basis of these various case studies, elaborate discussion on
> the mailing list and at various IETF conferences that we came to determin=
e

e

Simply saying *=E2=80=98We came to determine=E2=80=99* as the method for de=
termining the
central claims made in the document just isn=E2=80=99t good enough. You can
describe this process as  =E2=80=98proposing vectors of analysis=E2=80=99 i=
f you want but
this is no more than an obfuscated synonym for authors judgement.

If I was an aircraft engineer and my colleagues informed me that the
contents of the pre-flight check had been determined by people who had
talked to aircraft engineers doing doing =E2=80=98vectors of analysis=E2=80=
=99 and that no
criteria had then been used to evaluate and prioritise what we were being
asked to check then I would be terrified for the passengers. This exercise
is no less serious and demands no less rigour.

If the point of the document is to ask engineers to give greater attention
to the architectural features it highlights then a black box judgement
cannot be a solid enough basis on which to make that request.

It would be great to know whether others think the current method is
sufficient.

- Removing the proverbial co-chair hat

As I mentioned in a much earlier analysis of the document, I too feel
that the hypotheses need a more rigorous testing.  Of course and
exhaustive proof of the claims is impossible,  but an attempt to build
some rigorous test to test some of the conclusions in a falsifiable
manner would be helpful.

While the analysis done to date is good enough to motivate advocacy, I
do not believe it adequate scientific or even engineering evidenceproof.

- Replacing the proverbial hat

I too am very interested in hearing the views of others on the need to
test, and even on how such testing, if needed, could be done.  I think
it is one of the issue we will need to make an evaluation on as we move
forward with the research.

I find this claim unconvincing.

The security considerations approach had several historical features
that are quite different from the present case:

    1.  There was a security area with a fairly well-developed
    community involved directly in protocol design.

    2.  The failure mode in a missed security consideration is
    generally an immediate exposure of some particular bit of data.
    (This is part of the reason why, historically, pervasive
    surveillance didn't count.)

    3.  Nobody thought that the security of protocols was just an
    irrelevant political injection into protocol design.  There were
    questions about _which_ security ought to count, but not whether
    security as such was even relevant to protocol design.

It's (3) that seems to me to be the biggest issue here.  The I-D makes
a claim that human rights considerations are in fact relevant to
protocols, but as the I-D points out itself in §4, that is not a
completely uncontroversial claim.

Therefore, to me, a relationship between the rights in some framework
and a particular protocol or piece of functionality in a protocol is
what's needed, and the relationship needs to be demonstratable by
entailment from within the rights-framework in question.  If it's not,
then there's really no evidence that there's a rights consideration at
all.

Best regards,

A

Hi Andrew,

Does this mean that you find the case studies and guidelines for

Sometimes.

For instance, in 5.2.3, there's this:

    These capabilities for
   network control and limitations of the freedom of expression by end
   hosts can be traced back to the IPv4 design, helping us understand
   which technical protocol decisions have led to harm of these human
   rights.

It isn't clear to me whether that's a claim that is supposed to
introduce the next ¶ or whether it's a free standing one.  If it is
intended as introduction, the ¶ break makes it confusing.  If it's a
free-standing one, it's made completely without argument, is not
obviously true, and may just be empty since it's so imprecise.

The following ¶ is also problematic:

   Two major shifts have occurred to harm freedom of expression through
   misuse of the Internet Protocol.  The first is the network's
   exploitation of the public visibility of the host pairs for all
   communications, and the corresponding ability to discriminate and
   block traffic as a result of that metadata.  The second is the
   selective development of IP options.  Protocol extensions including
   Mobility and Multicasting have proposed alternate communication modes
   and suggest that different forms of assembly could be supported by a
   robust IP layer.  Instead, the protocol limited the deployability of
   such extensions by not providing a mechanism for appropriate fallback
   behavior when unrecognized extensions are encountered.

First, it isn't actually "the network" that has "exploited" the public
visibility of host pairs.  It is some operators of networks.  The
network design remains exactly as neutral as ever, and the ability to
block traffic may not anyway be a feature of the protocol so much as a
feature of Internetworking: your network, your rules, and that has to
mean the concomitant ability for you to block traffic on your network.
The claim about fallback behaviour is similarly contentious, and I
think perhaps somewhat anachronistic.  (You can't really have that two
ways: complaining about failures of v4 while ignoring features of v6
that are specifically there to correct some of these things appears to
demand some evidence that people are impeding v6 deployment.  For the
non-deployment of v6 suggests that maybe people don't care that much
about this.)

Now, one can read the follow-on sections as providing some of the
argument for the above.  But in that case, it's not clear to me why
some of the claims are expanded as they are in this section.

This is an example; I don't think the difficulties stop there.

Best regards,

A

Hi Harry,

Corinne and I have went through your comments, for which I would like to
thank you again. Most issues have been addressed in the draft that is
about to be published (for which you can find the md here:
https://github.com/nllz/IRTF-HRPC/blob/master/draft-research.md
, I think it made the draft much better, thanks a lot. There are a few
things unresovled though:

We have went with this solution because there is a lot of contention
about what 'decentralized' is. Therefore we said that everything that is
federated is by defintion distributed.
Are you proposing:
=C2=B7      Federation  The possibility of connecting autonomous systems =
into
single autonomous and possibly centralized system.?
Am not sure if it would be much clearer, I also do think that it is in
line with the provided definition of distributed system.

I think we'll keep this here, because it is an IRTF document (focusing
on research). If we want to guidelines to be normative or relevant for
the IETF we will need to bring it up there.

I do recognize this problem, but am not sure whether adding this hear
will add much to the purpose of the draft, but curious to hear opinions
from others on this.

There is increasingly work on P2P in IETF, am not sure why we should
exclude this (RFC5128, RFC5694, but also:
https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/p2psip/charter/ )

Could you provide us some text for this?

Thanks again for this great review.

I think we have discussed the non-neutrality of technology already at
lenghth. Also RFC3935:

   The Internet isn't value-neutral, and neither is the IETF.  We want
   the Internet to be useful for communities that share our commitment
   to openness and fairness.  We embrace technical concepts such as
   decentralized control, edge-user empowerment and sharing of
   resources, because those concepts resonate with the core values of
   the IETF community.  These concepts have little to do with the
   technology that's possible, and much to do with the technology that
   we choose to create.

The ease and ability of doing filtering (and surveillance) can still be
very different based on design of the protocol.

I think there are many reasons for adoption / non-adoption of IPv6, but
I don't think this is within the scope of this draft.

>=20

It is (trying to) show impact of specific design choices on human
rights. Please allow me to reiterate that this can be completely
legitimate, the excercise is trying to stimulate people to make
conscious choices about this and make aim to make it visible.

I would really appreciate a longer review, either on list or in person
in Berlin (or during the hrpc session there).


Best,

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Human Rights Protocol Considerations of the IETF.

        Title           : Research into Human Rights Protocol Considerations
        Authors         : Niels ten Oever
                          Corinne Cath
	Filename        : draft-tenoever-hrpc-research-03.txt

Abstract:
   The proliferating convolution of Internet and society increases the
   impact of the Internet on the lives of individuals.  Because of this,
   the design and development of the architecture of the Internet also
   has a growing impact on society.  This has led to an broad
   recognition that human rights [UDHR] [ICCPR] [ICESCR] have a role in
   the development and management of the Internet [HRC2012] [UNGA2013]
   [NETmundial].  It has also been argued that the Internet should be
   strengthened as a human rights enabling environment [Brown].

   This document provides a proposal for a vocabulary to discuss the
   relation between human rights and Internet protocols, an overview of
   the discussion in technical and academic literature and communities,
   a proposal for the mapping of the relation between human rights and
   technical concepts, and a proposal for guidelines for human rights
   considerations, similar to the work done on the guidelines for
   privacy considerations [RFC6973].

Hi John,

This somehow went wrong in Git versioing, sorry about that. I just
pushed the changed to Github, and I hope there will be more suggestions
from people so I can make -4 before Friday midnight, else it will be
after IETF96.

Sorry for the mistake and thanks for being sharp!

Cheers,

Niels

Much as I agree with Harry's concerns about patents, I'm a little
nervous that your document will become the kitchen sink to discuss all
evils.  That to me is a separate document.  One could in fact write a
book =E2=80=93 dare I say manifesto =E2=80=93 on that subject alone...

I recognize your concern, and it is by no means my intention to make
this draft a manifesto for everything that is right/wrong in protocols,
but rather a way to make impacts on peoples rights more visible and give
people a structure and document their decisions.

As Scott made it clear, we should make it very clear why we think this
is the case, preferably based on other research, examples and RFCs to
show that the relations between rights and protocol/practice are not
made intuitively, but rather building on best practices and real world
situations.

Best,

Niels

 Hey Niels,

Case examples are definitely good evidence in assessing whether a feature
could have an effect on a right and whether that effect is significant
enough to warrant addition attention by engineers.

However, I think what is needed is a set of criteria which allows for a
transparent and consistent assessment of the claims made for relationships
between features and rights. Case examples could form part of the evidence
base for this assessment.

I=E2=80=99d like to draw your attention to Section 5.2.2 'Translation human=
 rights
to technical terms=E2=80=99 where the document claims that the following li=
sted
features impact upon the right to freedom of expression.

"The combination of content agnosticism, connectivity, security, privacy
> (as defined in [RFC6973] ), and open standards are the technical principl=
es
> that underlie freedom of expression on the Internet.=E2=80=9D
>
>
> (  Connectivity )
>   (      Privacy                )
>   (      Security               )   =3D Right to freedom of _expression_
>   (      Content agnosticism    )
>   (      Internationalization   )
>   (      Censorship resistance  )
>   (      Open Standards         )
>    (     Heterogeneity support )




Instead of detailing the basis on which the claims within it rest, section
5.2.2 just asserts them. I think that, at a minimum, there needs to be
something inserted into 5.2.2 that describes how you have made these
judgements, or states that judgements are based on the intuition of the
authors.

Significantly for the point i=E2=80=99m trying to make, the visual represen=
tation
in the document appears to make three more claims than the paragraph. I.e
the diagram claims that Heterogeneity support, Internationalisation and
censorship resistance have an effect on the ability to exercise freedom of
expression whereas the paragraph does not.

This could well be a typo. But what if it=E2=80=99s not? Should we remove t=
he
features from the diagram or add them to the paragraph? How would we decide
whether your paragraph or your diagram is correct without any agreed
criteria for assessing claims? What should be the minimum effect that
merits inclusion?  This is the question that i=E2=80=99ve been pushing on.

If it is the case that that these relationships have been based on authors
intuition then we really have to go back to this section, unpack that black
box, and come up with a set of criteria that ensures these judgments are
being made in an transparent and consistent way.

Scott

<br>
I have been thinking a lot about your suggestions. I think the test you<br>
have been proposing might not be applicable for a technical environment<br>
(but am happy to be proven wrong).<br>
<br>
I do not think we can exhaustively list and map the risks that protocols<br=

generate in relation to rights.<br>
<br>
I would also like to add that the test you propose is neither part nor a<br=

requirement in for instance security considerations:<br>

<a href=3D"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3552" target=3D"_blank">https://t=
ools.ietf.org/html/rfc3552</a><br>
<br>
Similar to the guidelines on security considerations RFC3552 and the<br>
guidelines on privacy considerations RFC6973 we&#39;ve proposed vectors of<=
br>
analysis and provided examples.<br>
<br>
That these vectors might not be exhaustive and always context dependent<br>
are for me no arguments to hold the draft back.<br>
<br>
Furthermore I think the guidelines provide an input for discussion of<br>
drafts during drafting phase, but also when they&#39;re discussed for revie=
w<br>
in other WGs or later on in the IESG. Decisions and reviews are<br>
documented (and arguments are provided), so I am not sure whether one<br>
can say the standpoints are arbitrary, nor that the judgments are not<br>
replicable or cannot be contested (there are processes for that, that<br>
can get weighed by the appropriate groups). It is not like these<br>
guidelines for considerations are applied blindly.<br>

If I understood you incorrectly, could you perhaps illustrate the test a<br=

bit more in the specific case of security considerations?<br>

&gt; Though I agree with some of your conclusions, I do not think the<br>
&gt; justification for the claims you have made withstands scrutiny. As a<b=
r>
&gt; result it=E2=80=99s presently difficult to see how an engineer could j=
ustify<br>
&gt; giving additional attention to the features highlighted in the draft.<=
br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; To re-state what I said previously:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I think the method you have described (quoted below)*_is great for<br>
&gt; identifying _**/_candidate features_/*. But my concern is that it=E2=
=80=99s<br>
&gt; insufficient to determine that a candidate feature is an enabling (or<=
br>
&gt; restricting) feature.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0/&quot; It is on the basis of these various case st=
udies, elaborate<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0discussion on the mailinglist and at various IETF c=
onferences that<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0*we came to determine whether an architectural feat=

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&#39;crucial ingredient for enabling the ability to=
 exercise specific<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0rights=E2=80=99. &quot;/<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; If no explicit test is applied to the candidate features<br>
&gt; after identification, I think this causes three problems:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; (1) *Judgements* *are arbitrary=C2=A0 =C2=A0 *<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; i.e there is no basis on which to argue that the threshold for inclusi=
on<br>
&gt; was the same for one technical concept as for another.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; (2) *Judgements are not replicable. *<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; i.e it is not possible to claim that different authors would not have<=
br>
&gt; come to significantly different conclusions than you have.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; (3) *Judgements cannot be contested=C2=A0 *<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; e.g if someone were to disagree with your contention that<br>
&gt; internationalisation has a bearing on the right to political<br>
&gt; participation, on what basis would we adjudicate who is correct?<br>

I want to echo Scott's critique here... as someone who has done a lot
of qualitative research in my life, it's important that we describe
how "interviewing people" leads to "a model for mapping technical
features and human rights" which results in the bracketed
relationships in the document.

My naive suggestion here might be to write down in words how each of
the technical terms on the LHS individually enable/underlie/impact the
right on the RHS. (or if they necessarily work in concert, describe
that.)

I'm hopeful that after having done that for one or two of the human
rights, it might be easier to craft a more generic approach that could
work for any rights or rights that may light in our future.

Niels, Corrine: are we missing something fundamental?

Hello,

I volunteered to try to apply the guidelines in
draft-tenoever-hrpc-research to a draft that I have been working on
with some colleagues. Niels asked me to send my observations to the
list.

Summary
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
Basically I think that it is a useful checklist.

I think the list can be shortened (pointed out in detail below). Indeed
I worry a bit that it is too long, even with a few items removed.
Perhaps something can be written about the relative importance of the
items?

My Draft
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
I'm working with my colleagues on a "DNS over HTTP" draft. This
describes a protocol for encapsulating DNS messages and then sending
them over HTTP... kind of a protocol-specific tunnel in a way.

https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-song-dns-wireformat-http/

We don't really introduce any new protocols, but kind of duct-tape two
very popular protocols together.=20

This is very much useful as a tool for circumventing censorship (at
least the DNS part of censorship).

Highlights of the review
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
I have a detailed review which is probably only interesting for my
co-authors and myself. Here are some highlights that I think might be
interesting for this group.

BTW, while I have questions below, it's not really so important to give
*me* answers. Instead the hrpc draft should be clarified so that people
using it don't end up confused too. (Although it is possible that I am
just easily confused...)


5.3.2.1.2. Privacy

I had not looked at RFC 6973 section 7. This was a useful recommendation.

*** Are there experts we can ask for advice in this area? Maybe setting
    up a list of people willing to give advice would be useful...

5.3.2.1.8. Heterogeneity Support

*** This one confuses me. Is it asking if the protocol will work in
    heterogeneous environments or what?

5.3.2.1.9. Anonymity

I had not looked at RFC 6973 section 6. This was a useful
recommendation.

5.3.2.1.12. Localization

*** This one confuses me. Even though it references Internationalization I
    still don't know how this is different or what I am supposed to be
    considering.

5.3.2.1.15. Confidentiality

As a DNS protocol, DNS over HTTP exposes a ton of confidential information!

I think that I'll add a note in the draft about this, and mention that
proxies may want to consider what and how they log information, as
well as things like DNS query minimization.

*** Thanks, this was a big "win". :)

5.3.2.1.18. Acceptability

*** I'm not clear how this differs from accessibility.

5.3.2.1.19. Availability

*** I'm not sure how this is different from open standards, although I
    suppose it could be related to legal restrictions (such as laws
    against encryption or the like)?

5.3.2.1.20. Adaptability

*** I'm not really sure what to do about this, or what it means exactly.
    We have two inter-operable implementations, both open source, if
    that is somehow related?


Conclusion
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
My own feeling is that while this checklist is helpful in the current
form, it should probably be shortened and clarified.


Cheers,

--
Shane

There is ietf-privacy@ietf.org although I forget what purpose that
serves... and there is SAAG, but that might be too big of a tent for
this purpose. I'd be happy to find a home for this kind of function,
although I suspect more senior IETF folks (Stephen!) might have more
well-formed thoughts (although I'd still be willing to coordinate,
lead, etc.)

best, joe

Yes, however it's important to distinguish 'open standards', as defined
by a multi-stakeholder process and some reasonable way of dealing with
patents, versus closed standards done by closed committees that, despite
using the term 'standard', may involve intellectual property that harms
implementation by vendors, including but not limited to open-source.
Thus, I think as an important part of the appeal of the open internet
(and it's perhaps the primary reason why the W3C has member companies)
and in particular given the well-known problems in cryptography
resulting from patents, it deserves to be mentioned.

That edit would be a bit backwards.

The simplest edit would be "The possibility of connecting autonomous
systems into single system"

Since the term 'decentralization' can be difficult (unlike
'distributed', it isn't well defined in computer science), the more
complex edit would be "The possibility of connecting autonomous and
possibly centralized systems into single system without a central
authority."

If you are going to discuss the use of TLS, this should probably be
mentioned. In general, bolting on privacy and crypto after a protocol
like HTTP is already deployed is hard. I would note that "HTTP upgrading
to HTTPS is also vulnerable to having an attacker remove the "S" in any
links to HTTPS URIs from a web-page transferred in cleartext over HTTP,
an attack called "SSL Stripping" [1]. Thus, for high security use of
HTTPS IETF standards such as HSTS [2] and certificate pinning should be
used [3]."

"Defined" here was the word that confused me. SIP is just a
multimedia-over-IP protocol (used mostly for voice in my experience),
and p2psip is just a way of doing SIP with a p2p discovery service, i.e.
a DHT - unlike, say, most uses of WebRTC. Thus, P2PSIP is more of a
corner-case than a fundamental standard for P2P.  I am not aware of more
generic and popular deployed P2P frameworks (thinking Bitcoin, Tor,
BitTorrent, even FreeNet) that were standardized at the IETF. So, I'd
rephrase the sentence as

"Peer-to-Peer (P2P) is a network architecture in which all the
participant nodes can be responsible for the storage and dissemination
of information from any other node (as defined in {{RFC7574}}, an IETF
standard that uses a P2P architeture)."

My general take on P2P is summed up by Phil Agre quote: "Architecture is
politics, but it is not a substitute for politics" in his article "p2p
and the promise of internet equality." In fact, due to sybil attacks
that are quite easy to mount today,  I tend to discourage their use in
practical applications by at-risk human rights defenders.=20

"Do you normatively reference another standard that is not available
without cost? Are you aware of any patents that would prevent your
standard from being fully implemented?"

=2E.

"All standards that need to be normatively implemented should be freely
available and with reasonable protection for patent infringement claims,
so it can also be implemented in open source or free software. Patents
have often held back open standardization or been used against those
deploying open stadards, particularly in the domain of cryptography [1].
Patents in open standards or in normative references to other standards
should have a patent disclosure [2], royalty-free licensing [3], or some
other form of reasonable protection. Reasonable patent protection should
includes but is not limited to cryptographic primitives.

Dear Scott,

Am happy to work on (more) examples (as were mentioned in the
interviews, and found in the research). This would then be similar to
the documentation of attack vector examples in the Privacy
Considerations Guidelines and the Security Considerations Guidelines.
Corinne and I will come up with this shortly.

I am afraid though that it will lead to a duplication of the examples
mentioned under the considerations themselves though (at the bottom of
the ID), which would lead to an even longer document.

But if that's what's needed, here we go :)

Best,

Niels

Hey Niels,

I'm not asking for more examples i'm asking for one of two things;

Either

1. That you to describe the method by which you go from speaking to people
to concluding that a feature has a significant enough effect on a right to
merit inclusion in section 5.2.2.

Or

2. That if you don't have a method and this has just been black box authors
judgement then the list needs to develop one - for all of the reasons I've
set out before. A test being my initial proposal for one method to judge
the relevance of a feature upon a right outside of the current black box.

Joe's proposal seemed like a sensible way to begin pulling back the curtain
figuring out what the method was (or could be).

I don't understand why you are sidestepping the issue and focusing on
examples instead.

Am happy to work on (more) examples (as were mentioned in the<br>
interviews, and found in the research). This would then be similar to<br>
the documentation of attack vector examples in the Privacy<br>
Considerations Guidelines and the Security Considerations Guidelines.<br>
Corinne and I will come up with this shortly.<br>
<br>
I am afraid though that it will lead to a duplication of the examples<br>
mentioned under the considerations themselves though (at the bottom of<br>
the ID), which would lead to an even longer document.<br>
<br>
But if that&#39;s what&#39;s needed, here we go :)<br>

&gt; Instead of detailing the basis on which the claims within it rest,<br>

&gt; these judgements, or states that judgements are based on the intuition=

&gt;<br>
&gt; Significantly for the point i=E2=80=99m trying to make, the visual<br>
&gt; representation in the document appears to make three more claims than<=
br>
&gt; the paragraph. I.e the diagram claims that Heterogeneity support,<br>
&gt; Internationalisation and censorship resistance have an effect on the<b=

&gt; ability to exercise freedom of expression whereas the paragraph does n=
ot.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; This could well be a typo. But what if it=E2=80=99s not? Should we rem=
ove the<br>
&gt; features from the diagram or add them to the paragraph? How would we<b=
r>
&gt; decide whether your paragraph or your diagram is correct without any<b=

&gt; agreed criteria for assessing claims? What should be the minimum effec=
t<br>
&gt; that merits inclusion?=C2=A0 This is the question that i=E2=80=99ve be=
en pushing on.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; If it is the case that that these relationships have been based on<br>
&gt; authors intuition then we really have to go back to this section, unpa=

&gt; that black box, and come up with a set of criteria that ensures these<=

Hi Scott,

In that case I might have misunderstood your comments, let me try to
give it another try, what about replacing the existing explanatory
paragraph at 5.2.2:


   This analysis aims to translate human rights concepts that impact or
   are impacted by the Internet as follows:

   The combination of content agnosticism, connectivity, security,
   privacy (as defined in [RFC6973] ), and open standards are the
   technical principles that underlie freedom of expression on the
   Internet.

into:

The combination of the technical concepts that have been gathered the
steps above have been grouped according to their impact on specific
rights as they have been mentioned in the interviews done at IETF92 as
well as study of literature (see literature and discussion review above).=


This analysis aims to assist protocol developers by understanding better
understanding the roles specific technical concepts with regards to the
possibility to exercise human rights on the Internet.

This analysis does not claim to be an complete or exhaustive mapping of
all possible ways in which a protocols could potentially impact human
rights, but it presents an initial combined concept mapping based on
interviews and literature and discussion review.

Happy to discuss!

Best,

Niels

privacy@ietf.org is indeed the list for this. When you have any
questions on privacy implications of your draft that list will review
and provide guidance.

Yes, and whether it will in turn allow for multiple types of hardwae and
multiple types of application protocols.

Where these questions and the example under 5.3.2.1.8 not clear? Any
suggestions?

>=20

Internationalization is making it possible for a protocol,
implementation or application to be localized. The localization is the
actual act of translating and contextualizing it.

This bring about questions similar to the ones that were brought up by
Ramsey Nasser at IETF95 at his presentation.

nice!

>=20

>=20

>=20

Here we might run into a tech <-> law translation issue again.
Accessibility as it is used in the questionnaire refers to

: The design of protocols, services or implementation that provide an
enabling environment for people with disabilities.

Acceptability is a bit broader human rights concept that refers to
sensitizing protocol, in this case, toward the multiple forms of
discrimination that might arise at the intersection of race, gender,
class, ethnicity, disability or other identities and backgrounds.

Because accessibility is a better understood (and documented) term in
technology, we chose to keep them both.

It is, that is exactly what this aims to encourage. So I added:

"Is your protocol written in such a way that is would be easy for other
protocols to be developed on top of it, or to interact with it?"

Would this help?

Thanks a lot for this. I hope we can further discuss so we can shorten
and clarify further.

Best,

Hi all,

Based on the reviews and suggestions made by Scott, Harry, Shane,
Giovane and John I have made a new version.

It is only possible for me to submit a new version on th 17th, but while
everyone is preparing for IETF96 I thought it might be nice if you could
read the most recent version in an easily readible way.

Markdown:
https://github.com/nllz/IRTF-HRPC/blob/master/draft-research.md

Html:

Attached

Looking forward to discuss this at IETF96.

Best,

Niels

I'll comment about the SDO first.  There isn't any agreement in the 
IETF about what is human rights.  The UDHR reference was only 
mentioned during a controversy about a very controversial IETF 
issue.  I don't know whether that was discussed in the IRTF (the IRTF 
is not part of the IETF).  Some of the terms in your draft have been 
discussed on an IETF mailing list from a specification perspective, 
e.g. protocol, standards.

In response to your comment about the Brown et all paper, are you 
referring to the design choices which have "give users considerable 
autonomy"?  That could be viewed in terms of bypassing communication 
networks which were set within a country.

I was referring to the unique public name space instead of 
implementations of DNS.

Ok.

In your opinion, isn't the values a matter of ideology [1]?

I recall commenting about Section 8.3 of what became the 
specification for the Forwarded HTTP Extension.  If I had to provide 
an explanation fro my preference, I would say that I prefer to tell 
the user what is correct instead of what is not incorrect if there 
might be an impact on the user.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Human Rights Protocol Considerations of the IETF.

        Title           : Research into Human Rights Protocol Considerations
        Authors         : Niels ten Oever
                          Corinne Cath
	Filename        : draft-tenoever-hrpc-research-04.txt

Abstract:
   The proliferating convolution of Internet and society increases the
   impact of the Internet on the lives of individuals.  Because of this,
   the design and development of the architecture of the Internet also
   has a growing impact on society.  This has led to an broad
   recognition that human rights [UDHR] [ICCPR] [ICESCR] have a role in
   the development and management of the Internet [HRC2012] [UNGA2013]
   [NETmundial].  It has also been argued that the Internet should be
   strengthened as a human rights enabling environment [Brown].

   This document provides a proposal for a vocabulary to discuss the
   relation between human rights and Internet protocols, an overview of
   the discussion in technical and academic literature and communities,
   a proposal for the mapping of the relation between human rights and
   technical concepts, and a proposal for guidelines for human rights
   considerations, similar to the work done on the guidelines for
   privacy considerations [RFC6973].

I think there is quite a strong global consensus on what human rights
are, and there are documents in which these are documented, like the
UDHR, ICCPR and ICESCR. I do not think it's useful to redefine what
human rights are in the IETF or IRTF.

It has been extensively on this list.

Which have been studies, as you can find in the methdology paragraph of
the draft.

One doesn't need to agree on ideology in order to be able to agree on
values.

Yes.

Please see the thread which starts at 
https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/ietf/current/msg98613.html

A person follows the laws of his/her country.  For example, there 
aren't laws in every country about anonymity as a right [1].  Some 
countries do not have data protection laws.  I commented about 
Cybersecurity previously [2].  There has been standards-related 
discussions about encryption.  Should anonymity be built into the standards?

Sorry if any of teh above is not clear.  Please feel free to ask me to explain.

(apologies, mean to send this a few days ago but it's been sitting in
my Drafts folder for some stupid reason.)

I like this new language! I do think the bracket figures need to be
explained a bit more, but I think I can offer PRs for that (or can
offer language here and we can hammer that into a PR).

(Didn't the interviews happen at IETF91 (Honolulu) not 92 (Dallas)?)

Cheers and see you all at 3:50p!

Hi,

Laura DeNardis said something interesting in reply to me at the mic
today, and it caused me to get up again, but we were running out of
time.  But I think there's an important fact that we need to keep in
mind here.

Basically, the problem of open standards adoption is that of
incentives.  On the Internet, you can't actually force anyone to do
anything.  You can only give them the incentives to do things that you
want.  This is because it's a network of networks, and such a system
actually has no central point of control where you _could_ force.

So, in her remarks about examples like proprietary Internet payment
systems and "Internet of Things" protocols, there is a serious problem
in that people appear to be buying proprietary protocols.  (I might
suggest that the issues around several social media networks are just
the same: many of them are really closed protocols that happen to run
over the Internet instead of being part of the Internet.)  But people
are _choosing_ those proprietary systems, because that's what it means
when GiantMedia has 1 billion users and LightSwitchCo is selling to
people who install that switch.

The problem here, in effect, is the same one that the Free Software
advocates faced for many years (and mostly continue to face in
consumer-directed systems).  I believe that open protocols are much
better, but if people are willing to buy a device that only implements
proprietary protocols, it doesn't seem like there's much we can do
about that except make better alternatives.  And they've got to be
better in the sense that product makers prefer the interoperating
standards over their closed examples.

It therefore seems to me that the problem here is not protocol
considerations, but consumption considerations: if you value the
ability to use open systems, you should prefer them when buying.  Just
as you wouldn't buy a car that could only take the manufacturer's
special fuel, you shouldn't buy an Internet-connected device tht can't
talk to any other kind of device, either.

Best regards,

A

Nopes, the interviews happened in Dallas, I remember that hotel room

This seems a higher-level point than this research group is addressing,
but maybe not?

I mean, it sort of sounds like: "How can we design protocols that
convince people to deploy them?"=20

This is especially difficult since vendors have goals that are
opposite of openness: vendor lock-in is a bonus, access fees are a
great source of revenue, consumer control is a problem to be solved, and
so on.=20

As I say, this sounds like a general IETF (or wider) problem, not
necessarily a human rights issue.

Cheers,

Hi Andrew,

I think this is a bit off topic, but there are as I see it two issues:

  * Part of this is that we are in a maturity cycle for many Things in
    which the product makers need to get to market, and do not have the
    time or money to invest in standardizing the functions they have.  I
    see this in several areas, and usually this works for them until it
    doesn't, and it doesn't when enterprises wish not to be locked in.=20
    Some of the Things we are talking about do have long lifetimes, and
    so it may take a longer time for this to run its course than in
    previous iterations.
  * The consumer market is different: here the vendor actively has
    incentive to NOT come to SDOs, not simply due to the cost of doing
    so, but because they end up having to address interoperability
    problems that could lead to device malfunctions.  In the case of
    certain classes of devices, safety would be involved, aside from the
    simple desire to lock the consumer into a brand.  Running against
    this current is the promise of some sort of horizontal integration,
    but anyone who has worked on home networking knows that it is more
    promise than anything else (with some small exceptions).

That isn't to say there's no interoperability.  Your home gateway has
all sorts of standards information on the box.  Not so much yet your
Internet doorlock, and certainly not an Internet enabled toy.

      <pre wrap=3D"">Hi,

Laura DeNardis said something interesting in reply to me at the mic
today, and it caused me to get up again, but we were running out of
time.  But I think there's an important fact that we need to keep in
mind here.

Basically, the problem of open standards adoption is that of
incentives.  On the Internet, you can't actually force anyone to do
anything.  You can only give them the incentives to do things that you
want.  This is because it's a network of networks, and such a system
actually has no central point of control where you _could_ force.

So, in her remarks about examples like proprietary Internet payment
systems and "Internet of Things" protocols, there is a serious problem
in that people appear to be buying proprietary protocols.  (I might
suggest that the issues around several social media networks are just
the same: many of them are really closed protocols that happen to run
over the Internet instead of being part of the Internet.)  But people
are _choosing_ those proprietary systems, because that's what it means
when GiantMedia has 1 billion users and LightSwitchCo is selling to
people who install that switch.

The problem here, in effect, is the same one that the Free Software
advocates faced for many years (and mostly continue to face in
consumer-directed systems).  I believe that open protocols are much
better, but if people are willing to buy a device that only implements
proprietary protocols, it doesn't seem like there's much we can do
about that except make better alternatives.  And they've got to be
better in the sense that product makers prefer the interoperating
standards over their closed examples.

It therefore seems to me that the problem here is not protocol
considerations, but consumption considerations: if you value the
ability to use open systems, you should prefer them when buying.  Just
as you wouldn't buy a car that could only take the manufacturer's
special fuel, you shouldn't buy an Internet-connected device tht can't

Hello all,

Thanks a lot for a very productive meeting in Berlin. Thanks to dkg we
already have the notes done, you can find them here:

https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/96/minutes/minutes-96-hrpc

You can find all the slides and the recording here:

https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/96/hrpc.html

Comments and improvements are always welcome of course.

Looking forward to receive reviews for the research-ID in the coming
month before moving to RG last call, as agreed in the session:

https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-tenoever-hrpc-research-04

I will send an email in the coming week with some questions in relation
to Alissa's presentation here to the list, because I feel that
discussion was cut short in Berlin.

Also happy to continue any other discussion here of course.

Best,

Niels

TL;DR : good, and I think the RG last call (discussed in Berlin? I
don't find it in minutes) is a reasonable idea.

As you'll see, I have devoted most of my attention to section 5.

The biggest problem, IMHO, is the discussion of IP options in 5.2.3. I
know that we have already spent a lot of time on this (Andrew Sullivan
raised the point again a few weeks ago in "way forward
draft-tenoever-hrpc-research") but I still think the issue is
unsettled. The current text in -04 is on the verge of paranoid (by
giving the impression that the lack of multicast deployment was
deliberately engineered for evil purposes) and, more important, it
pushes "technical determinism" too far. The ability of people to
associate and interact does not depend on whether IPv4 multicast is
deployed or not. Basically, multicast was a bad idea from the
beginning (it works only when many people want to have access to the
same content AT THE SAME TIME, something which is now rare, except may
be for some sport events). Its absence does nothing to prevent people
from discussing on Web forums, mailing lists, or IRC channels.

I suggest to delete the text starting with "The second is the
selective..."

Another issue (which is not easy to solve) is the mention of Namecoin
in 5.2.4.1. The current text is technically correct but may give the
impression that Namecoin has only strengths, not weaknesses, and that
we endorse its use. I know it is not the case but I do not like the
current text, not because of what it says, but because of what it
omits. It claims "there is no technical auditing for name ownership
[in the DNS]" which is true but forgets to add that, in Namecoin,
there is a public ledger of changes, but based only on the possession
of a cryptographic key. If your machine is infected with malware, you
may lose your Namecoin name and there is no audit or recourse for
that (the ledger will only show "legitimate" changes.)

So, mentioning alternative techniques is a good idea, to illustrate a
point, but we must be careful to add that it is not a fair comparison.

Last important point, when rereading the evaluation of XMPP in 5.2.6,
I cannot help thinking it is technically correct but it may make
people consider that the XMPP authors were working for the NSA or the
FSB, trying very hard to break human rights in the protocol. May be
adding something that these evaluations are done on the basis of HR
influence, and that the engineers who built these protocols had many
other issues, and many trade-offs to consider (in the case of XMPP,
the use of the servers, which has a lot of consequences for HR, is
because user's machines are not reachable 100 % of the time.)

A few details (I can send pull requests if some of these points are
consensual):

5.2.5.1 : HSTS and certificate pinning are mentioned as solutions
against TLS stripping but not DANE (RFC 6698). Why?

5.2.11 : the end of the section is quite sudden. It regrets the lack
of a "de facto public space" but does not explain what it is (the
concept of "public space", where free speech and demonstrations are
possible, is not introduced anywhere). 

5.3.2.1.7 : "Yet, open standards are not explicitly defined
within the IETF" There is RFC 6852 but it is not a good reference
since it mentions IEEE, a very closed SDO (its standards are not even
freely available online). More a "governance circus" document than a
real definition of open standards.
   
Editorial :

5.2.5.2 : "The lack of a secure transport layer over HTTP connections"
Isn't it _under_ and not _over_? HTTP is layered over TLS.

5.2.9 : it should be updated with respect to the publication of RFC
7725. For instance, replace "would be named" with "is named".

Summary: I really would like to see this document published (and
quickly because it contains information which will become obsolete)
becasue it is really useful but, IMHO, there are still a few problems
to solve.

I copy the HRPC research group because the draft, unlike many drafts,
does not indicate a discussion venue. HRPC ? A security area mailing
list?



One of your TODOs:

"talk about content inference through things like TLS
fingerprinting?)" Probably yes, otherwise people may get the
impression that encryption hides perfectly everything. I would add,
after 3.2.5, a section "Identification with metadata" with something
like:

"A lot of information, leading to identification of something to
censor, can be deduced from metadata, such as the size of the
exchanged packets. TLS does nothing by default to hide this size and
it has been demonstrated it is exploitable (reference: "Peek-a-Boo, I
Still See You: Why Efficient Traffic Analysis Countermeasures Fail" by
Kevin P. Dyer, Scott E. Coull, Thomas Ristenpart, Thomas Shrimpton
<http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?reload=true&arnumber=6234422>).

Encryption alone does not work against this sort of inferences. There
are several additional ways to make inference more difficult, but they
are not obvious to use properly. One such way is padding, adding
gratuitous data (see for instance RFC 7830)."



Another one:

"organize this section into layers just like identification above.
Alternatively, the whole document can be organized in a layer
structure and do identification and interference at the same time for
each layer?  That seems wise.)" May be but it is a lot of work and I
would prefer to see the RFC published. Because it contains a lot of
information that could become outdated in a few years, a version -2
could be made afterwards, with updated content and this
reorganisation.



Technical :

3.2.1 "an HTTP method field is necessary to do anything useful" I
don't understand. AFAIK, you cannot send a HTTP request without
indicating a method (RFC 7230, section 3.1.1).

4.3 "Sequence number is the hardest to get correct" RFC 5961 should be
mentioned, since it describes the solutions to make it harder for the
attacker to guest, thus preventing RST injection.

4.4 As I said (this is noted in the draft), the term "cache poisoning"
has a very specific meaning for the DNS. The reference given
<http://viewdns.info/research/dns-cache-poisoning-in-the-peoples-republic-of-china/>
describes something which exists but is not a cache poisoning at all
(no cache is involved and the example is specially wrong because it
clearly says the cache has the correct information). Yes, for the
user, it is the same result in the end but, in a IETF document, we
must certainly be precise.

Cache poisoning could be done for censorship but, as I said, I'm not
aware of documented cases.

I've updated the minutes to be more clear about the hum.

I can live with this. And have adapted the text accordingly.

Sure, can you offer some text for this? We can also go for listing a few
short issues with Namecoin. Namecoin is only mentioned once, I do not
think it reads like a recommendation, but happy with considering adding
text.

PRs here pls:

Sure! We don't want to lambast XMPP, but simply show how hard it is.
Would you like to offer text? I can also have a stab at it. Let me know
what you think.

Let's add DANE, stupid to have not mentioned it. PR ?

We used to have much more text here, you can see it here:

(page 37). I would be more than happy to bring (parts of) this text back:=


DDoS although disruptive, and silencing at times, can also enable as
protest and speech. Or as Sauter {{Sauter}} argues: =91though DDoS as a
tactic is still relatively novel, it fits within a centuries- long
tradition of breaking laws and disrupting business as usual to make a
political point. These actions aren=92t simply disruption for disruption=92=
s
sake. Rather they serve to help the activist or dissenter to direct the
attention of the public through the interpolation of difference into
routine.=92 (30-31). An often heard argument against DDoS attacks is that=

you cannot construe it as a means to exercise your right to freedom of
speech, when the means used effectively impede the right of the party on
the receiving end of the attack to exercise that same right. The problem
with this line of argumentation is that it conveniently ignores the fact
that online DDoS attacks are often one of the few effective ways for
activists to gain the attention of the media, the government or other
parties of interest. Simply putting up a website for a cause won=92t
garner the same amount of attention as directly confronting the issue
via the website of the individual or organization at the heart of the
issue. The ability of activists to do so should be protected, especially
considering the fact that as Sauter (2014:4) explains: =91Collectively, w=
e
have allowed the construction of an entire public sphere, the Internet,
which by accidents of evolution and design, has none of the inherent
free speech guarantees we have come to expect. Dissenting voices are
pushed out of the paths of potential audiences, effectively removing
them from the public discourse. There is nowhere online for an activist
to stand with her friends and her sign. She might set up a dedicated
blog=97which may or may not ever be read=97but it is much harder for her =
to
stand collectively with others against a corporate giant in the online
space.=92 Although the Internet is often compared to public space, it is
not. Rather the opposite. The Internet is almost entirely owned by
private entities. And the IETF plays a crucial role in developing this
privatized commercialized Internet.

We've been struggling with this but did not want to re-invent the wheel.
Happy to have guidance on where to look. I would have thought IETF would
have a stronger position on this documented somewhere, or at least the IA=
B.

Changed, thanks.

Fixed, thanks!
