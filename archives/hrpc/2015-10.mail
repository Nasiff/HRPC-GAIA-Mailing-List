Hi all,

As laid out in our methodology, and discussed in Prague, we were going
to document cases of in which protocols could strenghten or harm human
rights (especially freedom of expression and/or freedom of assembly).
We found two people ready to document cases in which protocols
(potentially) strengthen or weaken human rights. Welcome on the list
Will and Nex. After a discussion we decided to look into some of the
following protocols: DNS [0], IP, VPN [1], HTTP, XMPP, TLS, mesh [2]
and PPSPP [3].

Please find underneath the first draft by Will on DNS, all input is
welcome of course. Tomorrow I will try to clean up the methodology
draft as discussed and insert it in there. In the mean time all
inputs, comments, questions and discussion points are very welcome!

Best,

Niels

DNS
=====

The Domain Name System (DNS), as specified in RFC 1035, acts as a core
switchboard for the internet - associating human readable names with
services. The DNS system operates a centralized core of ‘Root
Resolvers’ , servers run by a set of organizations trusted by IANA to
enact the organization’s decisions by accurately communicating which
organizations have been delegated to manage registration under each
Top Level Domain (TLD). Top Level domains are maintained and
determined by IANA, and have evolved to encompass several classes of
services. Some, like ‘.Com’ and ‘.Net’, provide a common space for
expression of ideas, though their policies are enacted through US
based countries. Other name spaces are delegated to specific
nationalities, and may impose limits designed to focus speech in those
forums both to promote speech from that nationality, and to comply
with local limits on expression and social norms. Finally, the system
has been recently expanded with the addition of “generic TLDs”, name
spaces with accompanying regulations aimed to promote expression
around specific topics, for instance ‘.travel’ and ‘.ninja’.

DNS has significant privacy issues, as described in RFC 7626. Notably
amongst these, the protocol does not offer either encryption to limit
the visibility of requests for domain resolution from several
intermediary parties, nor does it offer authentication, allowing the
client to know that they have received a correct, “authoritative”,
answer to a query. Together, these decisions have resulted in ongoing
harm to freedom of expression as the DNS protocol has become one of
the central mechanisms used to block access to websites - limiting
both the freedom of expression of the publisher to offer their
content, and the freedom of assembly for clients to congregate in a
shared virtual space.

There have been several mechanisms used impose these limitations based
on the technical design of the DNS protocol. These have led to a
number of situations where limits on expression have been imposed
through subversion of the DNS protocol. Each of these situations has
accompanying aspects of protocol design enabling those limitations.

Removal of records
- -----
There have been a number of cases where the records for a domain are
removed from the name system due to real-world events. Examples of
this removal include ‘seizure’ of names of illegally operating
gambling operations by the United States ICE unit by compelling the
US-based registrar in charge of the .com TLD to hand ownership of
those domains over to the government. The same technique has been
notably used by Libya to remove sites in violation of “our Country’s
Law and Morality [which] do not allow any kind of pornography or its
promotion.”

At a protocol level, the ability to seize domain names is enabled by
the lack of transparency into DNS transfers, or any technical encoding
of name ownership. Name ownership is purely a policy decision of
registrars. While DNSSEC addresses distortion events described below,
it does not tackle this problem, which is has the cooperation of (or
compels) the registrar.

Distortion of records
- -----
The most common mechanism by which the DNS system is abused to limit
freedom of expression is through manipulation of protocol messages by
the network. One form occurs at an organizational level, where client
computers are instructed to use a local DNS resolver controlled by the
organization. The DNS resolver will then selectively distort responses
rather than request the authoritative lookup from the upstream system.
The second form occurs through the use of deep packet inspection,
where all DNS protocol messages are inspected by the network, and
objectionable content is distorted.

At the national level, there are additional considerations. The most
notable is the interactions between DNS distortion and internet
routing. A study on collateral damage showed that the restrictions
imposed by China on DNS responses in its network also affected the
availability of sites to users in Germany, since some fraction of
requests would transit through the Chinese network, even though none
of the participants were located there.

A notable instance of distortion has occurred in Greece [3], where a
study found evidence of both of deep packet inspection to distort DNS
replies, and overblocking of content, where ISPs prevented clients
from resolving the names of domains which they were not instructed to
do through the governmental order prompting the blocking systems there.

At a protocol level, the effectiveness of these attacks is made
possible by a lack of authentication in the DNS protocol. The DNSSEC
protocol is not widely in use, but provides an extension allowing the
client to know that a response is ‘Authoritative’ - that it has been
generated by the server which has technical ownership of the name
requested. Even still, there are a range of downgrade attacks, where a
client may continue to follow the resolution of an injected message
without such a signature, since it may not know that it should expect
the response to be signed. Selective distortion of records has also
been made possible by the predictable structure of DNS messages, which
make it computationally easy for a network device to watch all passing
messages even at high speeds, and the lack of encryption, which allows
the network to distort only an objectionable subset of protocol messages
.

Injection of records
- -----
Responding incorrectly to requests for name lookups is the most common
mechanism that in-network devices use to limit the ability of end
users to discover services. A deviation which accomplishes a similar
objective, though may be seen as different from a freedom of
expression perspective, is the injection of incorrect responses to
queries.  The most prominent example of this behavior occurs in China,
where requests for lookups of sites which have been deemed
inappropriate will trigger the network to respond with a bogus
response, causing the client to ignore the real response when it
subsequently arrives. Unlike the other forms of discussion discussed
above, injection does not stifle the ability of a server to announce
it’s name, it instead provides another voice which answers sooner.
This is effective because of the DNS protocol’s decision to provide
whatever answer it receives first, and stop listening for subsequent
answers, and enabled by the lack of authentication or encryption in
the protocol.

Hi Niels,

I found the doc on DNS privacy consideration quite useful, do you have plan=
s to produce visuals or videos which can explain in a simplified way the "p=

Hi Hanane,

AFNIC usually published some easy-to read document about DNS for public
https://www.afnic.fr/medias/documents/afnic-dns-attacks-security-guide-2009=
-06.pdf
. maybe not necessarily targeting activists .
maybe other registry operators and DNS providers have such material too.

Best,

Rafik

Hi all,<br>
<br>
As laid out in our methodology, and discussed in Prague, we were going<br>
to document cases of in which protocols could strenghten or harm human<br>
rights (especially freedom of expression and/or freedom of assembly).<br>
We found two people ready to document cases in which protocols<br>
(potentially) strengthen or weaken human rights. Welcome on the list<br>
Will and Nex. After a discussion we decided to look into some of the<br>
following protocols: DNS [0], IP, VPN [1], HTTP, XMPP, TLS, mesh [2]<br>
and PPSPP [3].<br>
<br>
Please find underneath the first draft by Will on DNS, all input is<br>
welcome of course. Tomorrow I will try to clean up the methodology<br>
draft as discussed and insert it in there. In the mean time all<br>
inputs, comments, questions and discussion points are very welcome!<br>

<br>
DNS<br>
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D<br>
<br>
The Domain Name System (DNS), as specified in RFC 1035, acts as a core<br>
switchboard for the internet - associating human readable names with<br>
services. The DNS system operates a centralized core of =E2=80=98Root<br>
Resolvers=E2=80=99 , servers run by a set of organizations trusted by IANA =
to<br>
enact the organization=E2=80=99s decisions by accurately communicating whic=
h<br>
organizations have been delegated to manage registration under each<br>
Top Level Domain (TLD). Top Level domains are maintained and<br>
determined by IANA, and have evolved to encompass several classes of<br>
services. Some, like =E2=80=98.Com=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98.Net=E2=80=99, pro=
vide a common space for<br>
expression of ideas, though their policies are enacted through US<br>
based countries. Other name spaces are delegated to specific<br>
nationalities, and may impose limits designed to focus speech in those<br>
forums both to promote speech from that nationality, and to comply<br>
with local limits on expression and social norms. Finally, the system<br>
has been recently expanded with the addition of =E2=80=9Cgeneric TLDs=E2=80=
=9D, name<br>
spaces with accompanying regulations aimed to promote expression<br>
around specific topics, for instance =E2=80=98.travel=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=
=98.ninja=E2=80=99.<br>
<br>
DNS has significant privacy issues, as described in RFC 7626. Notably<br>
amongst these, the protocol does not offer either encryption to limit<br>
the visibility of requests for domain resolution from several<br>
intermediary parties, nor does it offer authentication, allowing the<br>
client to know that they have received a correct, =E2=80=9Cauthoritative=E2=
=80=9D,<br>
answer to a query. Together, these decisions have resulted in ongoing<br>
harm to freedom of expression as the DNS protocol has become one of<br>
the central mechanisms used to block access to websites - limiting<br>
both the freedom of expression of the publisher to offer their<br>
content, and the freedom of assembly for clients to congregate in a<br>
shared virtual space.<br>
<br>
There have been several mechanisms used impose these limitations based<br>
on the technical design of the DNS protocol. These have led to a<br>
number of situations where limits on expression have been imposed<br>
through subversion of the DNS protocol. Each of these situations has<br>
accompanying aspects of protocol design enabling those limitations.<br>
<br>
Removal of records<br>
- -----<br>
There have been a number of cases where the records for a domain are<br>
removed from the name system due to real-world events. Examples of<br>
this removal include =E2=80=98seizure=E2=80=99 of names of illegally operat=
ing<br>
gambling operations by the United States ICE unit by compelling the<br>
US-based registrar in charge of the .com TLD to hand ownership of<br>
those domains over to the government. The same technique has been<br>
notably used by Libya to remove sites in violation of =E2=80=9Cour Country=
=E2=80=99s<br>
Law and Morality [which] do not allow any kind of pornography or its<br>
promotion.=E2=80=9D<br>
<br>
At a protocol level, the ability to seize domain names is enabled by<br>
the lack of transparency into DNS transfers, or any technical encoding<br>
of name ownership. Name ownership is purely a policy decision of<br>
registrars. While DNSSEC addresses distortion events described below,<br>
it does not tackle this problem, which is has the cooperation of (or<br>
compels) the registrar.<br>
<br>

<br>
Distortion of records<br>
- -----<br>
The most common mechanism by which the DNS system is abused to limit<br>
freedom of expression is through manipulation of protocol messages by<br>
the network. One form occurs at an organizational level, where client<br>
computers are instructed to use a local DNS resolver controlled by the<br>
organization. The DNS resolver will then selectively distort responses<br>
rather than request the authoritative lookup from the upstream system.<br>
The second form occurs through the use of deep packet inspection,<br>
where all DNS protocol messages are inspected by the network, and<br>
objectionable content is distorted.<br>
<br>
At the national level, there are additional considerations. The most<br>
notable is the interactions between DNS distortion and internet<br>
routing. A study on collateral damage showed that the restrictions<br>
imposed by China on DNS responses in its network also affected the<br>
availability of sites to users in Germany, since some fraction of<br>
requests would transit through the Chinese network, even though none<br>
of the participants were located there.<br>
<br>
A notable instance of distortion has occurred in Greece [3], where a<br>
study found evidence of both of deep packet inspection to distort DNS<br>
replies, and overblocking of content, where ISPs prevented clients<br>
from resolving the names of domains which they were not instructed to<br>
do through the governmental order prompting the blocking systems there.<br>
<br>
At a protocol level, the effectiveness of these attacks is made<br>

protocol is not widely in use, but provides an extension allowing the<br>

client may continue to follow the resolution of an injected message<br>

Injection of records<br>
- -----<br>
Responding incorrectly to requests for name lookups is the most common<br>
mechanism that in-network devices use to limit the ability of end<br>
users to discover services. A deviation which accomplishes a similar<br>
objective, though may be seen as different from a freedom of<br>
expression perspective, is the injection of incorrect responses to<br>
queries.=C2=A0 The most prominent example of this behavior occurs in China,=
<br>
where requests for lookups of sites which have been deemed<br>
inappropriate will trigger the network to respond with a bogus<br>
response, causing the client to ignore the real response when it<br>
subsequently arrives. Unlike the other forms of discussion discussed<br>
above, injection does not stifle the ability of a server to announce<br>
it=E2=80=99s name, it instead provides another voice which answers sooner.<=
br>
This is effective because of the DNS protocol=E2=80=99s decision to provide=
<br>
whatever answer it receives first, and stop listening for subsequent<br>
answers, and enabled by the lack of authentication or encryption in<br>
the protocol.<br>

Hi Hanane,

We're currently producing a film on the relation between Internet
protocols and Internet rights which will premiere at IETF94 in
Yokohama, and after that will be available online.

The film is based largely on interviews we did with the IETF community
at IETF92 in Dallas, but we're creating animations and adding other
content to make it a bit more attractive and digestible right now.

Best,

Niels

> Please find underneath the first draft by Will on DNS,

> The DNS system operates a centralized core of ‘Root Resolvers’ ,

Please pay attention to the terminology. There is no such thing as a
root resolver. This was probably a reference to root servers. Also,
the adjective "centralized" seems strange here.

> servers run by a set of organizations trusted by IANA

Precisely not (this is one of the darkest secrets of Intenet
governance). The root server operators existed long before ICANN, the
vast majority of them have zero relationshiop with ICANN and there is
no ICANN process to add or remove a root server.

Add "acting as a delegate of the US governement"

This is untrue, because of DNSSEC (which is mentioned later but
ignored in this sentence).

> the US-based registrar in charge of the .com TLD

Registry not registrar.

I do not see what is the "lack of transparency into DNS transfers".

> or any technical encoding of name ownership.

Is it a reference to alternative techniques like proving name
ownership through cryptographic signatures plus a public record, such
as Namecoin? If so, it could be explained more clearly.

Self contradictory sentence: either DNSSEC exists or it doesn't. If it
exists (which is the case), there *is* "authentication in the DNS
protocol".

Either there is a technical weakness in DNSSEC, allowing this attack,
and it must be published, to allow IETF to patch the DNSSEC protocol
(or to drop it), or this is pure FUD (I have no idea of where does
this sentence come from).

Technical note: the DNS client knows that "it should expect the
response to be signed" through the DS (Delegation Signed)
records. When there is really no DS, the client knows it through
"secure denial of existence", thanks to NSEC and NSEC records.

Thanks a lot for these comments Stephane.

Agree. This is where we will need to get into a precise description of
what centralized and distributed means.

This would be really interesting to dig out and describe more
precisely. You got some more info, links or guidance here Stephane, or
do we need to dig up 'Ruling the Root' by Milton Mueller?

+1. Let's make a real clear differentiation here between what is often
implemented and what is in the protocol. I think here were should
solely focus on the protocol.

Thanks again Stephane, really useful. Are there any other
vulnerabilities you think that should be mentioned?

I'm afraid (from my memory) that Mueller's book does not mention the
management of the root name servers. As I said, it is one of the best
kept secrets of Internet governance. The professionals of the
governance circus typically ignore this issue (too practical? too
difficult?).

This is how I understand it, but please correct me if I'm wrong (also
looping in Patrik here):

ICANN, under the IANA function, manages the IANA database. If changes
are made, changes are subsequently checked by the NTIA. The actual
changes are then made by Verisign (who have a direct contract with
NTIA [0]) in the a-root. And the other 12 roots then federate from the
a-root.

I think this is regularly described as a hierarchical distributed
system. (This definition could help us stay away from the discussion
whether this is centralized or not).

Question from my side: were there ever any discrepancies between the
root servers, other than those caused by a time lag?

Stop destroying dreams, Stephane. Hope dies last ;)

But since the process is ongoing, it would be good to mention. Let's
stick to the facts, no?

Niels

Hi,

This is part of what the DNS does, it's true.  But the more accurate
depiction is that this is an important but not only job of the DNS.
The DNS is also used, for instance, in various service discovery
systems.  It can also be used as a rather nice way to improve user
security by allowing use of strong cryptography without dependence on
Certificate Authorities.

Apart from the corrections Stephane sent, I think it's important to
recognise that the DNS is not at all centralized.  The DNS is arguably
the most successful distributed database system ever built or
operated.  It is decentralized in two ways.  First, the authority in
the system is decentralized.  When you get a domain name delegated to
you, nothing about your operation of that is thereafter controlled (in
a technical sense) _except_ the delegation.  It's true your parent can
remove the delegation, but that's all they can do.  Second, it's also
decentralized in operation, by virtue of caches theoretically governed
by the Time To Live setting established by the zone operator.  It's
really radically decentralized.

It's also worth noting tht the root servers are the root servers
because they're the ones everyone uses.  You can change this on your
own resolver, if you want, by changing the root.hints file you use.
Of course, if people start using various different roots, and they're
not operating a single namespace, then we no longer have one Internet,
but multiple.  That's a risk of "multiple roots".

> Top Level domains are maintained and
> determined by IANA,

It would be nice to draw a distinction here, because this point has
caused a lot of trouble in the IANA transition this year.  ICANN has
two roles.  IANA today (historically less so) is mostly a clerical
job.  So it's strictly true that IANA places the TLDs in the root
zone, but it does so according to policy decisions made by ICANN in
its policy-making function, and not in its IANA function.

The basic idea that gTLDs have any particular function is fetching but
no longer really true.  I don't know what a "US-based country" is, but
maybe that means "company".  It's true that many of the organizations
operating gTLDs are US-based, but not all.  For instance, Afilias
operates info and is incorporated in Ireland.

The addition of gTLDs is not a recent expansion: that's what com and
net are too.  Perhaps "recently expanded with additional generic TLDs".

> around specific topics, for instance ‘.travel’ and ‘.ninja’.

No, the ones that have specific topics are sometimes called "sponsored
TLDs", but the ICANN-level policy difference is at best minimal.  The
operator of any domain can make policies about what may be registered
in it, and that's how the new scope-limited gTLDs are working: they
adopt rules about who may register or what those registrations may be
used for.  Many of the new gTLDs have no different policies than com
or net or org.

Authentication is offered by DNSSEC, which is now enjoying some modest
deployment success, so that seems not too relevant.

I think I'd say, "interference with the operation of the DNS has
become one of the …".

The DNS mechanism here is simply the ability to remove a delegation.
That is the sole technical function that is invoked, and it's an
administrative decision (i.e. actually a policy decision) imposed by
the technical means of removal of the delegation.  In the presence of
DNSSEC, the delegation cannot be undetectably blocked by a third
party.  While it is true that detectably blocking something can
suppress speech, it does so in the same way that redaction via black
lines over text does: the reader can tell.

This is external to the DNS, but it's not the case that there is no
such transparency.  That's what whois gets you.  The whois (and we
hope its replacement by RDAP) provides the view you're looking for.

I think this part is conflating issues and doesn't belong here.

As I note above, DNSSEC should be reflected earlier.  Moreover, one
can hardly claim a weakness on the grounds that people aren't using
the technology available.

If it does not know that, it hasn't performed validation.  It is never
possible under DNSSEC not to know that the response should be signed
unless one is not validating or the name is not properly signed.

No, injection also won't work in the face of DNSSEC, either.

Best regards,

Hi all,

Here are initial thoughts on analysis of XMPP.
If there are additional aspects you want to flag as potentials for harm,
specific citations you'd like to see, or items here you'd take issue with,
I'd appreciate the feedback.

--Will

XMPP
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), specified in RFC
3920, provides a standard for interactive chat messaging, and has evolved
to encompass interoperable text, voice, and video chat. The protocol is
structured as a federated network of servers, similar to email, where users
register with a local server which acts one their behalf to cache and relay
messages. This protocol design has many advantages, allowing servers to
shield clients from denial of service and other forms of retribution for
their expression, and designed to avoid central entities which could
control the ability to communicate or assemble using the protocol.

None-the-less, there are plenty of aspects of the protocol design of XMPP
which shape the ability for users to communicate freely, and to assembly
through the protocol. In addition to issues of user registration and a lack
of protocol specification of the registration policy, the protocol also has
facets that may stifle speech as users self-censor for fear of
surveillance, or find themselves unable to express themselves naturally.

User Identification
------
The XMPP specification specifies that clients are identified with a
resource (<node@domain/home> / <node@domain/work>) to distinguish the
conversations to specific devices. This has the side effect of enabling
tracking of user behavior by a remote friend or server, who are able to
track presence not only of the user, but of each individual device. This
has proven to be misleading to many users, since many clients only expose
user level rather than device level presence. Likewise, user invisibility
so that communication can occur while users don=E2=80=99t notify all buddie=
s and
other servers of their availability is not part of the formal protocol, and
has only been added as an extension within the XML stream rather than
enforced by the protocol.

Documentation of this form of harm:
[1] https://developer.pidgin.im/ticket/4322

Character Encoding
-----
Localization is a source of frustration in many protocols, and appears in
some forms of XMPP. The XMPP protocol specifies a requirement for UTF-8 and
UTF-16 support [1], though documentation admits that many implementations
may not support UTF-16 [2]. In practice, this leads to cases where text
encoded outside of a standard english language ascii encoding will fail to
render on all clients, limiting the ability of users to communicate in
their native languages. Some examples are failure of XMPP servers to handle
non-ascii passwords [3], and gateways which simply strip all non-ascii from
the conversation stream.

At the protocol level, XMPP only defines the conversation as an XML block,
and leaves the implementation of character sets to the XMPP parsers of each
individual client and server. While there have been attempts to define
UTF-16 support as part of the protocol specification, the lack of actual
implementation of the more extensible character set by all clients has
shaped the protocol to harm the full range of expression users may desire.

[4] https://wiki.bitlbee.org/HowtoFacebookXMPP

Surveillance of Communication
-----
The XMPP protocol specifies the standard by which communication of channels
may be encrypted, but it does not provide visibility to clients of whether
their communications are encrypted on each link. In particular, even when
both clients ensure that they have an encrypted connection to their XMPP
server to ensure that their local network is unable to read or disrupt the
messages they send, the protocol does not provide visibility into the
encryption status between the two servers. As such, clients may be subject
to selective disruption of communications by an intermediate network which
disrupts communications based on keywords found through Deep Packet
Inspection.

In particular, section 13.14 of the protocol specification [2] explicitly
acknowledges the existence of a downgrade attack where an adversary
controlling an intermediate network can force the inter domain federation
between servers to revert to a non-encrypted protocol were selective
messages can then be disrupted.

Documentation of this form of harm:

t
[2] https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6120.txt



Group Chat Limitations
-----
Group chat in the XMPP protocol is defined as an extension within the XML
specification of the XMPP protocol [1]. However, it is not encoded or
required at a protocol level, and not uniformly implemented by clients.

The design of multi-user chat in the XMPP protocol suffers from extending a
protocol that was not designed with assembly of many users in mind. In
particular, in the federated protocol provided by XMPP, multi-user
communities are implemented with a distinguished =E2=80=98owner=E2=80=99, w=
ho is granted
control over the participants and structure of the conversation.

Multi-user chat rooms are identified by a name specified on a specific
server, so that while the overall protocol may be federated, the ability
for users to assemble in a given community is moderated by a single server.
That server may block the room and prevent assembly unilaterally, even
between two users neither of whom trust or use that server directly.

If the focus is solely on the current protocol then it would seem there
is no use to go into any of the social or political flaws in the current
root server or name server structure and organization. I would posit
that the motivations behind the creation of RFC 4033 are very relevant
to this discussion. A simple enumeration of the current flaws or
benefits within these documents would ignore the rich history of the
IETF responding to perceived flaws that have, or will lead to human
rights violations. I am sure there is far more context to be found in
the archive of the 4033 email list that may directly talk to the
incidents that inspired its creation, but the first draft included a
threat model section that exposes some of context.

"Threat Model

   The Domain Name System (DNS) protocol has been the target of several
   well-publicized attacks since it's creation.  These attacks are
   centered on altering DNS traffic in transit, or sending erroneous
   referral messages to caching servers (i.e. "cache poisoning").   The
   result of these attacks are traffic redirection or complete "zone
   hijacking" if the malicious referral code is allowed to propagate."

The "well-publicized attacks" that spawned the creation of DNSSEC hint
at how wide scale human-rights abuses have, and should, be taken into
consideration in the creation and revision of Internet protocols. I
think the history of protocols that have changed, possibly because of
human rights concerns, are as important as their current possible
ability to harm/strengthen human rights because it provides us concrete
protocol issues that have been addressed in the past, and a glimpse at
how protocol level changes can be made to directly respond to flawed
social or political structures and abuses.

Good stuff.

I'm not sure end-user is the right term but I do think there's
a valuable thing in your draft. I hope you persevere with it.

More or less random comments, for none of which I have an
answer to suggest, sorry.

- I don't know how a routing person could use this as a guide
for how to act - perhaps this is really an application layer
concept, or maybe there's a good generalisation that could be
made, I'm not sure. But considering that seems like a thing
that ought be done. (You may have done it, but that's not
visible in the draft.)
- If end-users like something that's not really good for them
(e.g. handing over all their personal information to a few
mega-companies) then are we supposed to prioritise things based
on how they behave or how we think they ought behave? (Or even
on how we think we ought behave..)
- The set of identifiable parties doesn't only include those
who benefit from our standards, but also those who lose, e.g.
hopefully criminals and spooks will lose, but so will some
companies with some business models, and so will some sets
of people. That can be important when considering trade-offs
in that the delta in outcome for a losing class of persons
may be a good, or a bad, thing.
- If we achieve rough consensus on this text, are we then
saying that this newly BCP'd principle trumps rough consensus?
- "core values" - I'm not sure we have one set of those that we
all agree to, and perhaps we don't need that if we have a scheme
like rough consensus (see previous point)
- "Extensions to existing standards MUST document..." - that's
not going to happen and, I suspect, if ever reduced to concrete
steps would end up as mere pointless bureaucracy,
- The use of "MAY estimate" puzzles me - what does it mean?
- "informed consent" - I think that's a fiction and a damaging
one, being impossible and yet used to justify lots of things, at
least as mostly used.
- I'm not sure the HTTPS as a two party protocol is a good way
to look at things. Today, a web transaction often involves a user,
operating system, browser, network operator, maybe some proxies, a
data centre/hosting/cloudy provider, a web server operator, and only
then we get to what the user may perceive as being the 2nd party.
(Which party can also be a whole menagerie of entities, an inbound
proxy or load balancer, a web front-end, ...) And all of that
omits the DNS entities, the spooks listening in and probably more.
- I'm really unsure this is something on which we could reach rough
consensus, but tha's the kind of thing I think is worth finding out.
Later though.
- In the meantime, I hope this is on some agenda in Yokohama and for
discussion over some beers.

More nitty things:

- I don't think the code-regulates quote is useful, personally I
find it problematic, and all you need to say is that the code that
implements RFCs has obvious impact
- It's somehow cute that you choose 6525 as an example of harm;-)
- This really reads like something that a functioning IAB would
produce, I'm not sure what conclusion to draw from the fact that
this is being offered for discussion to a list that is not even
a formally chartered IRTF RG. Mostly, I guess that's good. But
maybe it'd be better if the IAB were emitting such drafts. (Well,
so long as the content wasn't mad of course:-)

Cheers,
S.

Hi Mark et all,

Thanks for posting this here. I think this is a valuable place to
discuss this draft because we're working on similar issues here,
things that might eventually converge (since human rights are
individual rights), but where it's home should be, I leave it to you.

I would be more than happy to add a discussion of this draft (no
strings attached) to the agenda of the hrpc session in Yokohama.

I have some similar remarks to Stephen. There are quite some
considerations in there, but not as many guidelines as one would hope.
There are MUST, SHOULDs and MAYs in there, but not as many
descriptions of how this should be done.

Where is comes to value neutrality and objective of the IETF, you
might want to refer to RFC3935 - IETFs mission statement - which reads:

[QUOTE]

   The Internet isn't value-neutral, and neither is the IETF.  We want
   the Internet to be useful for communities that share our commitment
   to openness and fairness.  We embrace technical concepts such as
   decentralized control, edge-user empowerment and sharing of
   resources, because those concepts resonate with the core values of
   the IETF community.  These concepts have little to do with the
   technology that's possible, and much to do with the technology that
   we choose to create.

[/QUOTE]

Or perhaps to RFC1958.

Some responses to Stephen comments:

Prioritize things on how we think the interests of the user are best
protected (as described in IETF standards), which they can choose to
ignore. The other way around is much harder, no?

+100. If one reaches a decision, all parts of the decision making
process should be made transparent. This will make future decision
making much easier as well.

Depends how these would be formulated, right? As guidelines, need for
documentation, tool in the decision making process, or preconditions
for new RFCs.

If it would be the latter, if would be a criterium for IESG review, righ
t?

But I guess it's more likely to take the form of (several of) the former
.

There definitely are values, also expressed in RFCs. Do you think that
consensus also trumps those? That would make rough consensus 'the
ultimate value / touchstone'.

+100. Informed consent is inherently broken (and "I have read and
agree with the terms and conditions' is the most prevalent lie on the
Internet) as shown in several articles:

Prof. Daniel Solove's article on why consent is broken
http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2171018

Lorrie Cranor & Aleecia MacDonald article on how it would take 76
days to read privacy policies for services an average user uses
(old but gold) -

Yes.

As said, happy to put it on the agenda of the hrpc session.

And you could illustrate that with the IETF statements, which probably
makes it stronger in IETF fora.

Not sure if I understand this process suggestion since Mark is not in
the IAB, right?

Hi all,

Below is an initial discussion on tradeoffs at the IPv4 level, and
specifically harms associated with RFC791. Again, if there are other
protocol related harms you'd like to see flagged, feedback is welcome!

--Will

IP
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
The Internet Protocol version 4, known as =E2=80=98layer 3=E2=80=99 of the =
internet, and
specified as a common encapsulation and protocol header, is defined by RFC
791. The evolution of Internet communications have led to continued
development in this area, encapsulated in the development of version 6 of
the protocol in RFC 2460. In spite of this updated protocol, we find that
25 years after the specification of version 6 of the protocol, the older v4
standard continues to account for a sizable majority of internet traffic.

The internet was designed as a platform for free and open communication,
most notably encoded in the end-to-end principle, and that philosophy is
also present in the technical implementation of the Internet Protocol. [1]
While the protocol was designed to exist in an environment where
intelligence is at the end hosts, it has proven to provide sufficient
information that a more intelligent network core can make policy decisions
and enforce policy shaping and restricting the communications of end hosts.
These capabilities for network control and limitations of the freedom of
expression by end hosts can be traced back to the IPv4 design, helping us
understand which technical protocol decisions have led to harm of these
human rights.

Two major shifts have occurred to harm freedom of expression through misuse
of the Internet Protocol. The first is the network=E2=80=99s exploitation o=
f the
public visibility of the host pairs for all communications, and the
corresponding ability to discriminate and block traffic as a result of that
metadata. The second is the selective development of IP options, so that
protocol extensions promoting assembly and expression like Mobility and
Multicasting can fail to receive support from IP compatible devices. This
lack of forward compatibility where extensions can receive a baseline level
of support needed to extend the design has stymied forms of expression
which could have been extended to support these human rights.

[1] https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3724.txt

Network visibility of Source and Destination
-----
The IPv4 protocol header contains fixed location fields for both the source
and destination IP addresses [1]. These addresses identify both the host
sending and receiving each message, and allow the core network to
understand who is talking to whom, and to practically limit communication
selectively between pairs of hosts. Blocking of communication based on the
pair of source and destination is one of the most common limitations on the
ability for hosts to communicate today, [2] and can be seen as a
restriction of the ability for those hosts to assemble or to consensually
express themselves.

We have seen from other instantiations of protocols, even those comparable
to IPv4, that other designs are possible. IPv4 even encodes a defined
option and specification for source routing of packets, where the source
can specify or suggest a routing path, and as the message passes through
those paths, the part of the path it has completed are removed from the
path. This design has the potential to make it much more difficult for an
individual router in the network to stifle speech, since it will cannot do
the same level of differentiation on the source of the messages.
Unfortunately, many networks prevent the use of source routing, and the
protocol is not designed such that support of that ability is required in
order for the protocol to be implemented.

orship-by-david-post/

Protocols
-----
The other major feature of the IP protocol header is that it specifies the
protocol encapsulated in each message in an easily observable form, and
does not encourage a design where the encapsulated protocol is not
available to a network observer.  This design has resulted in a
proliferation of routers which inspect the inner protocol, and has resulted
in a stagnation where only the TCP and UDP protocols are widely supported
across the Internet. While the IP protocol was designed as the entire set
of metadata needed for routing, subsequent enhanced routers have found
value on making policy decisions based on the contents of TCP and UDP
headers as well, and are encoded with the assumption that only these
protocols will be used for data transfer. [1] This has prevented
development of more secure protocols, since there=E2=80=99s a need to provi=
de
sufficient metadata with each message for routers to make positive policy
decisions if you hope the protocol will be available to all users.

[2] https://www.chromium.org/quic
[3] https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4960

Address Translation and Mobility
-----
A major structural shift in the Internet which has undermined the protocol
design of IPv4, and has significantly reduced the freedom of end users to
communicate and assemble in the introduction network address translation.
[1] Network address translation is a process whereby organizations and
autonomous systems to connect two networks by translating the IPv4 source
and destination addresses between the two. This process puts the router
performing the translation into a privileged position, where it can decide
which subset of communications are worthy of translation, and whether an
unknown request for communication will be correctly forwarded to a host on
the other network.

This process of translation has widespread adoption despite promoting a
process that goes against the stated end-to-end process of the underlying
protocol [2]. In contrast, the proposed mechanism to provide support for
mobility and forwarding to clients which may move, encoded instead as an
option in the IP protocol [3], has failed to gain traction. This situation
again suggests that the compromise made in design of the protocol has
resulted in a technology which failed to technical encode the freedom of
expression goals it was designed to promote.

I am not sure it is either a secret of has always been ignored.  I
remember it being discussed as far back as the working Group on Internet
Goverance (WGIG) in 2005. The WGIG Report says the following:
> Lack of formal relationship with root server operators.
>  The root zone operators perform their functions today without a
> formal relationship with any authority.

The WGIG Background report also contains a discussion, though not as
explicit as yours. There have been other references over the years in
various Internet Governance Forum (IGF) and other discussions.

Over the years there have been many discussions in the various Internet
governance venues of the fact that root server operators are each
independent operators,  who do what they do based on their own decisions
with loose informal coordination among themselves. This notion of
informal coordination is central to much of the technical management of
the Internet.  There are those who have wanted to find a way to add
international governance to that, but up to now that has remained a non
starter. As you say, it may be too difficult.

There have also been some discussions over the years questioning whether
DNSSEC in some sense bound these root server a bit more as it removed
some of their  discretion about which records they accepted, providing a
technical measure of coordination.

I am not making a normative statement at this point about whether this
independence and the DNSSEC are helpful or not to freedom of expression
and association, but just trying to argue that is not quite as  deep and
dark a secret among the 'circus' professionals as presented.  I do agree
that getting Internet governance of the root server operators does not
seem to be a current work item - root servers are not even mentioned in
the early drafts of  WSIS+10 paper the UN General Assembly will be
approving at the end of the year.  I am also sure that many of the
participants in Internet governance know nothing about this, but it
isn't a dark secret and it has been discussed over the years.

Thanks for all the feedback. I'm working through updating the the first
draft, and will drop root server discussion and will do some more diligence
at living in our modern dnssec world.

Injection of records, as in the case of China, does seem to be one of the
major attacks that the protocol has historically (and in practice
continues) to be vulnerable to; despite being mitigated by DNSSEC.  I'd be
interested in input in how that might be most effectively framed. Andrew
seems to suggest the injection section is hard to justify from the
protocol, and hurts the argument. Is there consensus that it should be
dropped?

Hello everybody.
Here are some initial considerations on P2P networks. This is a complex
one to address as implementations and use cases vary so much. I'm sure
it needs to be expanded upon, but this could a starting point.




                                    PEER-TO-PEER


    Introduction

Peer-to-Peer (P2P) is a network architecture (defined in RFC7574) in
which all the participant nodes are equally responsible engaged into the
storage and dissemination of information. A P2P network is a logical
overlay that lives on top of the physical network, and allows nodes (or
"peers") participating to it to establish contact and exchange
information directly from one to each other. The implementation of a P2P
network may very widely: it may be structured or unstructured, and it
may implement stronger or weaker cryptographic and anonymity properties.
While its most common application has traditionally been file-sharing
(and other types of content delivery systems), P2P is increasingly
becoming a popular architecture for networks and applications that
require (or encourage) decentralization. A prime example is Bitcoin (and
similar cryptocurrencies), as well as Skype, Spotify and other
proprietary multimedia applications.

In a time of heavily centralized online services, peer-to-peer is often
seen as an alternative, more democratic, and resistant architecture that
displaces structures of control over data and communications and
delegates all peers equally to be responsible for the functioning,
integrity, and security of the data. While in principle peer-to-peer
remains critical to the design and development of future content
distribution, messaging, and publishing systems, it poses numerous
security and privacy challenges which are mostly delegated to individual
developers to recognize, analyze, and solve in each implementation of a
given P2P network.


    Network Poisoning

Since content, and in some occasions peer lists, are safeguarded and
distributed by its members, P2P networks are prone to what are generally
defined as "poisoning attacks". Poisoning attacks might be directed
directly at the data that is being distributed, for example by
intentionally corrupting it, or at the index tables used to instruct the
peers where to fetch the data, or at routing tables, with the attempt of
providing connecting peers with lists of rogue or non-existing peers,
with the intention to effectively cause a Denial of Service on the network.


    Throttling

Peer-to-Peer traffic (and BitTorrent in particular) represents a high
percentage of global Internet traffic and it has become increasingly
popular for Internet Service Providers to perform throttling of
customers lines in order to limit bandwidth usage[1] and sometimes
probably as an effect of the ongoing conflict between copyright holders
and file-sharing communities[2].

Throttling the peer-to-peer traffic makes some uses of P2P networks
ineffective and it might be coupled with stricter inspection of users'
Internet traffic through Deep Packet Inspection techniques which might
pose additional security and privacy risks.


    Tracking and Identification

One of the fundamental and most problematic issues with traditional
peer-to-peer networks is a complete lack of anonymization of its users.
For example, in the case of BitTorrent, all peers' IP addresses are
openly available to the other peers. This has lead to an ever-increasing
tracking of peer-to-peer and file-sharing users[3]. As the geographical
location of the user is directly exposed, and so could be his identity,
the user might become target of additional harassment and attacks, being
of physical or legal nature. For example, it is known that in Germany
lawfirms have made extensive use of peer-to-peer and file-sharing
tracking systems in order to identify downloaders and initiate legal
actions looking for compensations[4].

It is worth nothing that there are varieties of P2P networks that
implement cryptographic practices and that introduce anonymization of
its users. Such implementations proved to be successful in resisting
censorship of content, and tracking of the network peers. A primary
example is FreeNet[5], a free software application designed to
significantly increase the difficulty of users and content
identification, and dedicated to foster freedom of speech online[6].


    Conclusions

Encrypted P2P and Anonymous P2P networks already emerged and provided
viable platforms for sharing material, publish content anonymously, and
communicate securely[7]. If adopted at large, well-designed and
resistant P2P networks might represent a critical component of a future
secure and distributed Internet, enabling freedom of speech and freedom
of information at scale.

I think there's an important aspect here that deserves highlighting; not =
only is lack of anonymity an issue, but also the privacy of the user's =
activity is extremely difficult to protect.

That's because fundamentally, you have to ask your peers for content by =
some identifier, and they can use that identifier to discover what =
you're requesting. Freenode admits as such [1]

Private Information Retrieval theoretically can avoid this, but AFAIK =
this isn't implemented in any P2P system, nor is it likely to be soon, =
due to the technical challenges (would be VERY happy to be proven wrong =
on this point).

Of course, this isn't an issue if you implicitly trust your peers; =
however, that doesn't seem a very good assumption to make for human =
rights considerations...

Cheers,

Hi,

Thanks for this contribution.

A question on throttling:  while used extensively against BitTorrent, I
think that it would be a broader issue. 

>From reading the use cases, I have begun to think that there is much as
case to made for some of the combinatorial effects of protocols as well
as the effect of the individual protocols.

No, 6120.

It is a feature, not a bug: every server has its own policy (from "no
registration allowed" on IETF XMPP server, to very lax).

Nothing mandates that the resource is a location, or that it is
understandable from the outide (the relevant RFC is RFC 7622, section
3.4). It is true that resources like "home" or "work" appear often in
the documentations and even in some RFC. A possible improvment would
be a privacy considerations section in the successor of RFC 7622,
warning of this risk.

I do not see the relationship between this problem and the UTF-8
vs. UTF-16 issue.

Certainly, the users want to communicate in their own script (not
language: IETF protocols don't know languages). But it is less evident
that they want passwords in Unicode (see RFC 7613). I would say it is
a problem but a much less severe one.

Gateways between protocols are notorious for mangling. It is unfair to
blame it on XMPP.

I'm not sure I understand this sentence (UTF-16 is certainly not "more
extensible"). If I do, it makes no sense to me, since UTF-8 and UTF-16
can encode exactly the same character set (Unicode).

This, and the fact that there is no standard end-to-end encryption,
meaning that a rogue server knows the conversation.

This could be a place to mention OTR (and to note it is poorly
integrated in XMPP).

Strong disagreement here. Not on the unfortunate state of IP options
(we agree here) but on the fact that IP mobility or multicasting
enable "assembly and expression". I fear you go to far in technical
determinism here.

IP mobility, first. Technically, it is a bad idea from the beginning,
assuming layer has to handle mobility. Actually, most of the time,
mobility is better managed by applications (Pidgin for IM, all Twitter
clients for Twitter, all email clients, rsync and BitTorrent nodes for
file transfer, mosh for ssh, etc).

Multicasting, second. Again, a bad idea from the beginning:
multicasting is only beneficial when everybody access the same content
at the very same time. Except religious ceremonies like the SuperBowl,
it is less and less common. Most interactions are not synchronous and
therefore do not depend on multicasting.

You lost me here. Filtering based on the pair source<->destination is
most of the time done by a router which is close from the two
communicating machines. Source routing wouldn't help since you have no
choice of the edge routers. In countries where there is widespread IP
address filtering, there are only a few communcation points with the
outside and, again source routing would not help.

A better solution, Tor, does not depend on source routing.

They are absolutely right, given the security risks of source routing.

There is an IETF-sanctioned solution, ESP. Little deployment, I
know. But any encrypting tunnel can do the same.

Hi Will,

Since it is the most prevalent attack, I do not think it should be
dropped, but it should be shown this is mitigated by the use of
DNSSEC. However DNSSEC is not mandatory, so the the protocol still
allows for this vulnerability imho.

Best,

Very good text, very useful. IMHO, HRPC is a reasonable place (but do

This is covered in the last paragraph of section 2. Choices like this
one must be discussed (currently, "handing over all their personal
information to a few mega-companies" is certainly not an informed
decision taken after careful examination of the pros and cons).

Criminals are stake-holders, too :-)

I like it. What is problematic in it?

You mean 6265?

An important point about P2P is that the typical user's daily
experience is not a pure P2P one but there is a big mandatory
centralised step, such as ThePirateBay for BitTorrent. The use of P2P
for real applications show us which features are hard to do in a fully
P2P way (here, search).

Hi,

While somewhat early, wanted to proposed a document that the RG,
assuming we continue to actually becoming an RG, could eventually use
report of the work and first considerations once we get further down the
road.

This proposal, would bring together much of the work that we are doing
in a single draft that we could then put forward for consideration as a RFC.

At this point it is more of a glorified outline than the document I plan
for it to become, but, before going too far down the road figured I
should put it out as a draft, draft-doria-hrpc-report-00,  before
Yokohama.  Which means I need to get as far as I am going to get by the
19th.

In keeping with the tradition that has been set in this group of
floating the markdown version of the drafts on this list before putting
them out as a IDs, I enclose the following.

--- abstract

This document present an overview of the project to map engineering
concepts at the protocol level that may be related to promotion and
protection of the freedom of expression and association.

This first draft is intended to provide the framework for reporting on
the study, initial results and basic considerations. At a later stage it
will fold in the work being done in the Methodology and Glossary drafts
as well as the work being done in the case studies. It also folds in
some of the text included in the original proposal for the HRPC.

Background
============

The recognition that human rights have a role in Internet policies has
become part of the general discourse.  Several reports from former
United Nations (UN) Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection
of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, Frank La Rue, have
made such relation explicit, which lead to the approval of the landmark
resolution "on the promotion, protection and enjoyment of human rights
on the Internet" at the UN Human Rights Council (HRC).  And, more
recently, to the resolution "The right to privacy in the digital age" at
the UN General Assembly.  The NETmundial outcome document affirms that
human rights, as reflected in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
{{UDHR}}, should underpin Internet governance principles.

Nevertheless, the direct relation between Internet Standards and human
rights is still something to be explored and more clearly demonstrated.

Concerns for freedom of expression and association were a strong part of
the world-view of the community involved in developing the first
Internet protocols.  Apparently, by intention or by coincidence, the
Internet was designed with freedom and openness of communications as
core values.  But as the scale and the commercialization of the
Internet has grown, the influence of such world-views had to compete
with other values, such as ease of development and cost. The purpose of
this research is to discover and document the consideration involved in
taking human rights into account when creating protocols.

In a manner similar to the work done for RFC 6973 {{RFC6973}} on Privacy
Consideration Guidelines, the premise of this research is that some
standards and protocols can solidify, enable or threaten user rights.

As stated in RFC 1958 {{RFC1958}}, the Internet aims to be the global
network of networks that provides unfettered connectivity to all users
at all times and for any content.  Open, secure and reliable 
connectivity is essential for rights such as freedom of expression and
freedom of association, as defined in the Universal Declaration   of
Human Rights {{UDHR}}.  Therefore, considering connectivity as the
ultimate objective of the Internet, this makes a clear case that the  
Internet is not only an enabler of human rights, but that human rights
lie at the basis of, and are ingrained in, the architecture of   the
network.

An essential part of maintaining the Internet as a tool for
communication and connectivity is security.  Indeed, "development of
security mechanisms is seen as a key factor in the future growth of  the
Internet as a motor for international commerce and communication"   RFC
1984 [RFC1984] and according to the Danvers Doctrine RFC 3365 
{{RFC3365}}, there is an overwhelming consensus in the IETF that the 
best security should be used and standardized.

In RFC 1984 {{RFC1984}}, the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) and the 
Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG), the bodies which oversee  
architecture and standards for the Internet, expressed: "concern by  the
need for increased protection of international commercial   transactions
on the Internet, and by the need to offer all Internet   users an
adequate degree of privacy."  Indeed, the IETF has been   doing a
significant job in this area {{RFC6973}} {{RFC7258}}, considering 
privacy concerns as a subset of security concerns.  {{RFC6973}}

Besides privacy, it should be possible to highlight other aspects of 
connectivity embedded in standards and protocols that can have human
rights considerations. This report focuses on freedom of expression and
the right to association and assembly online. 

Terminology
============

Currently defined in draft-dkg-hrpc-glossary to be folded in at
appropriate time

Link between protocols and human rights
=====================================

+ Include discussion of value laden engineering as discussed in {{Cath}}
+ Include discussion of  "Values and Networks" work by Roland Bless
+ Include discussion of principles from NetMundial Multistakeholder
Statement


Discussion of Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and Internet
Architecture
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This project is focused on two rights defined in the UDHR {{UDHR}},
Article 19 on Freedom of Expression and Article 20 of Freedom of
Association.

Article 19.
:   Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this
right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to
seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and
regardless of frontiers.

Article 20.
:  1 Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association.
:  2 No one may be compelled to belong to an association.


Theory
--------------

When looking at protocols the considerations can apply from several
perspectives.

+   The protocol's direct effects on human rights on the Internet.
+   The protocol's direct effect  on human rights in combination with
other protocols
+   The effect of specific protocol elements, separately or in
combination with other protocol elements on human rights on the Internet
+   The ability to determine when various effects are occurring, i.e.
transparency
+   The effect of deployment or non deployment.  While this may be may
seem beyond the protocol itself, often the design of protocol, its
difficulty in implementation and the degree to which it contains
required elements, poison pills or other protocol artifacts that either
encourage or discourse implementation or deployment can be significant
in the overall human rights affect of a protocol.


Other relevant research
-------------------------

Look at some of the academic research on the topic including David Post,
Jonathan Zittrain and Laura Denardis, among others.

Methodology
============

Currently defined in detail in draft-varon-hrpc-methodolgy to be folded
in at appropriate time.  this will largely be a reproduction of Section
3 of that document that focuses on the methodology

Briefly methodology has included:
+ scoping the research problem
- determining terminology to be use linking engineering and human rights
concepts
- establishing methodology
- case studies on a set of protocols
- derivation of possible considerations

Case Studies
============

In each of the case studies, the behavior of the protocols is analysed
for its positive and negative effects.  In some case these effects are
due to the design of the protocol itself, in others they are due to
existing or absent features.

Early versions of the analysis on the following protocols are currently
being discussed on HRPC list.  Once the discussions have matured those
discussions will be folded in this section.

DNS
--------------

Text being done by Will Scott on the HRPC list.

IP
--------------

Text being done by Will Scott on HRPC list.

HTTP
-------------

Text being done by Nex / Claudio on HRPC list.

XMPP
-------------

Text being done by Will Scott on HRPC list.

P2P
-------------

Text being done by Nex on HRPC List.


Possible areas for protocol considerations
==========================================

The case studies point to several areas of protocol behavior that may be
appropriate for considerations: 

+ Character encoding for internationalization
- DNS Record
  - Distortion
  - Injection
  - Removal
- Network Poisoning
- Traffic
  - Interception
  - Manipulation
  - Throttling
- User Identification
  - Source and Destination visibility
  - Tracking

Additionally, discussion of the rights themselves and the evidence of
these rights being implicits in the IETF design principles {{clark}} and
in some of the existing architecture and protocols {{Cath}}
{{Liddicoat}}, suggest other considerations.

Next Steps
============

Once the first take at consideration are defined, what are the next
steps for creating something that can be sesable for protocol designers
and implementers in considering freedom of expression and and freedom of
association in their work.

I think the section on identifying / managing relevant parties should be =

The harder part would be showing how they prioritise the end user. I'm =

Thoughts?

Indeed. Ultimately, they need to get involved in the process to have =
immediate effect, or refuse to adopt our protocols to have a more =
delayed effect. Either way implies some level of organised effort (which =
we do see sometimes).=20

I've done some work on the intro, see:

Sure. The point is to identify the actors so people can judge for =
themselves whether they like the outcome, and then act accordingly (when =
the document comes up for LC and when it comes time to adopt the =
technology).

That argument could be made for many documents we produce. This is a =
guide; the process shows us how to apply it.

The mission statement seems to think so.

I think this could be stated as a goal rather than an outcome -- i.e., =

See (for this and the point above):

That clearly talks about it as just a protocol, not the entire Web =
ecosystem.

So far, the reaction has been pretty encouraging. I think we need to =

I really like it, my draft so I'll keep it for now :)

Multicasting, second. Again, a bad idea from the beginning:<br>

Hello,

Here are some brief considerations on the privacy and security
properties of VPNs. There are more considerations to be made and a lot
more technical details to get into, but I hope this could be a good start.

Best,
C.

# Virtual Private Network

## Introduction

A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a point-to-point connection that
enables two computers to communicate over an encrypted tunnel. There are
multiple implementations and protocols used in provisioning a VPN, and
they generally diversify by encryption protocol or particular
requirements, most commonly in proprietary and enterprise solutions.
VPNs are used commonly either to enable some devices to communicate
through peculiar network configurations, or in order to use some privacy
and security properties in order to protect the traffic generated by the
end user; or both. VPNs have also become a very popular technology among
human rights defenders, dissidents, and journalists worldwide to avoid
local illegitimate wiretapping and eventually also to circumvent
censorship. Among human rights defenders VPNs are often debated as a
potential alternative to Tor or other anonymous networks. Such
comparison is mislead, as some of the privacy and security properties of
VPNs are often misunderstood by less tech-savvy users, which could
ultimately lead to unintended problems.

As VPNs increased in popularity, commercial VPN providers have started
growing in business and are very commonly picked by human rights
defenders and people at risk, as they are normally provided with an
easy-to-use service and sometimes even custom applications to establish
the VPN tunnel. Not being able to control the configuration of the
network, and even less so the security of the application, assessing the
general privacy and security state of common VPNs is very hard. Often
such services have been discovered leaking information, and their custom
applications have been found flawed. While Tor and similar networks
receive a lot of scrutiny from the public and the academic community,
commercial or non-commercial VPN networks are way less analyzed and
understood, and it might be valuable to establish some standards to
guarantee a minimal level of privacy and security to those who need them
the most.

## False sense of Anonymity

One of the common misconception among users of VPNs is the level of
anonymity VPN can provide. This sense of anonymity can be betrayed by a
number of attacks or misconfugrations of the VPN provider. It is
important to remember that, contrarily to Tor and similar systems, VPN
was not designed to provide anonymity properties. From a technical point
of view, the VPN might leak identifiable information, or might be
subject of correlation attacks that could expose the originating address
of the connecting user. Most importantly, it is vital to understand that
commercial and non-commercial VPN providers are bound by the law of the
jurisdiction they reside in or in which their infrastructure is located,
and they might be legally forced to turn over data of specific users if
legal investigations or intelligence requirements dictate so. In such
cases, if the VPN providers retain logs, it is possible that the
information of the user is provided to the user's adversary and leads to
his or her identification.

## Logging

With VPN being point-to-point connections, the service providers are in
fact able to observe the original location of the connecting users and
they are able to track at what time they started their session and
eventually also to which destinations they're trying to connect to. If
the VPN providers retain logs for long enough, they might be forced to
turn over the relevant data or they might be otherwise compromised,
leading to the same data getting exposed. A clear log retaining policy
could be enforced, but considering that countries enforce very different
levels of data retention policies, VPN providers should at least be
transparent on what information do they store and for how long is being
kept.

## 3rd Party Hosting

VPN providers very commonly rely on 3rd parties to provision the
infrastructure that is later going to be used to run VPN endpoints. For
example, they might rely on external dedicated server hosting providers,
or on uplink providers. In those cases, even if the VPN provider itself
isn't retaining any significant logs, the information on the connecting
users might be retained by those 3rd parties instead, introducing an
additional collection point for the adversary.

## IPv6 Leakage

Some studies proved that several commercial VPN providers and
applications suffer of critical leakage of information through IPv6 due
to improper support and configuration[1]. This is generally caused by a
lack of proper configuration of the client's IPv6 routing tables.
Considering that most popular browsers and similar applications have
been supporting IPv6 by default, if the host is provided with a
functional IPv6 configuration, the traffic that is generated might be
leaked if the VPN application isn't designed to manipulate such traffic
properly.

## DNS Leakage

Similarly, VPN services that aren't handling DNS requests and are not
running DNS servers of their own, might be prone to DNS leaking which
might not only expose sensitive information on the activity of the user,
but could also potentially lead to DNS hijacking attacks and following
compromises.

## Traffic Correlation

As revelations of mass surveillance have been growing in the press,
additional details on attacks on secure Internet communications have
come to the public's attention. Among these, VPN appeared to be a very
interesting target for attacks and collectiong efforts. Some
implementations of VPN appear to be particularly vulnerable to
identification and collection of key exchanges which, some Snowden
documents revealed, are systematically collected and stored for future
reference. The ability of an adversary to monitor network connections at
many different points over the Internet, can allow them to perform
traffic correlation attacks and identify the origin of certain VPN
traffic by cross referencing the connection time of the user to the
endpoint and the connection time of the endpoint to the final
destination. These types of attacks, although very expensive and
normally only performed by very resourceful adversaries, have been
documented[2] to be already in practice and could completely vanify the
use of a VPN and ultimately expose the activity and the identity of a
user at risk.

Thanks for the great set of comments.  I've tried to incorporate them into
a second draft:

https://github.com/willscott/IRTF-HRPC/commit/808c9b57bbf50e6ba3c717e73445a=
8ef8f97991b

As before, feedback is welcome.
One point I haven't included that might be worth including is a discussion
of name minimization. In the initial DNS implementation, and continuing in
many resolvers, the requests to the root server and tld server include the
full requested name.  This has resulted in passive surveillance of those
high-traffic servers.

<br>
Since it is the most prevalent attack, I do not think it should be<br>
dropped, but it should be shown this is mitigated by the use of<br>
DNSSEC. However DNSSEC is not mandatory, so the the protocol still<br>
allows for this vulnerability imho.<br>

I<br>
&gt; remember it being discussed as far back as the working Group on<br>

&gt; following:<br>
&gt;&gt; Lack of formal relationship with root server operators. =E2=80=A2 =
The<br>
&gt;&gt; root zone operators perform their functions today without a<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; The WGIG Background report also contains a discussion, though not<br>
&gt; as explicit as yours. There have been other references over the<br>
&gt; years in various Internet Governance Forum (IGF) and other<br>
&gt; discussions.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Over the years there have been many discussions in the various<br>
&gt; Internet governance venues of the fact that root server operators<br>

&gt; This notion of informal coordination is central to much of the<br>

&gt; wanted to find a way to add international governance to that, but<br>
&gt; up to now that has remained a non starter. As you say, it may be<br>
&gt; too difficult.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; There have also been some discussions over the years questioning<br>
&gt; whether DNSSEC in some sense bound these root server a bit more as<br>
&gt; it removed some of their=C2=A0 discretion about which records they<br>
&gt; accepted, providing a technical measure of coordination.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I am not making a normative statement at this point about whether<br>

=E2=80=8BPerhaps it is also interesting to mention the recent UNESCO study?
http://www.unesco.org/new/en/internetstudy
as it focuses specifically on the importance of developing the Internet on
the basis of human rights principles.

=E2=80=8BI think we need to be careful about using "user rights" and "human=
 rights"
interchangeably - it's confusing, and
user rights have a completely different legal basis than human rights
(sorry for being Cpt. Obvious here). But
it's feedback I have gotten on a continous basis, and is a legitimate issue
to address I feel.=E2=80=8B

This document present an overview of the project to map engineering<br>
concepts at the protocol level that may be related to promotion and<br>
protection of the freedom of expression and association.<br>
<br>
This first draft is intended to provide the framework for reporting on<br>
the study, initial results and basic considerations. At a later stage it<br=

will fold in the work being done in the Methodology and Glossary drafts<br>
as well as the work being done in the case studies. It also folds in<br>
some of the text included in the original proposal for the HRPC.<br>

<br>
The recognition that human rights have a role in Internet policies has<br>
become part of the general discourse.=C2=A0 Several reports from former<br>
United Nations (UN) Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection<br>
of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, Frank La Rue, have<br>
made such relation explicit, which lead to the approval of the landmark<br>
resolution &quot;on the promotion, protection and enjoyment of human rights=
<br>
on the Internet&quot; at the UN Human Rights Council (HRC).=C2=A0 And, more=
<br>
recently, to the resolution &quot;The right to privacy in the digital age&q=
uot; at<br>
the UN General Assembly.=C2=A0 The NETmundial outcome document affirms that=
<br>
human rights, as reflected in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights<br>
{{UDHR}}, should underpin Internet governance principles.<br>

Discussion of Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and Internet<br>
Architecture<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
This project is focused on two rights defined in the UDHR {{UDHR}},<br>
Article 19 on Freedom of Expression and Article 20 of Freedom of<br>
Association.<br>
<br>
Article 19.<br>
:=C2=A0 =C2=A0Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; =
this<br>
right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to<br>
seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and<br>
regardless of frontiers.<br>
<br>
Article 20.<br>
:=C2=A0 1 Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and associ=
ation.<br>
:=C2=A0 2 No one may be compelled to belong to an association.<br>

difficulty in implementation and the degree to which it contains<br>
required elements, poison pills or other protocol artifacts that either<br>

in the overall human rights affect of a protocol.<br>

Case Studies<br>
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D<br>

In each of the case studies, the behavior of the protocols is analysed<br>
for its positive and negative effects.=C2=A0 In some case these effects are=
<br>
due to the design of the protocol itself, in others they are due to<br>

The draft says "The second form occurs through the use of deep packet
inspection, where all DNS protocol messages are inspected by the
network, and objectionable content is distorted, as in [turkey]." But
the article it references never mentions in-network DPI. As far as I
know, in Turkey, it was always through lying resolvers that censorship
was implemented.

Also "The DNS system is organized around a set of independently
operated 'Root Servers' run by organizations around the web" Are we
talking of the Internet or the Web? Also, the DNS is certainly not
organized around the root servers.

The patch is empty "There isn’t anything to compare.  nllz:master is
up to date with all commits from willscott:abdcc13. Try switching the
base for your comparison." draft-varon-hrpc-methodology-01 still uses
the very same text (that I find objectionable) about mobility and
multicasting.

The XMPP section did not change since the drafts-of-drafts which were
posted here. I regret it (the internationalisation section is
especially confusing).

I'm afraid that no technical protocol can establish the truth, which
is a difficult philosophical concept. Technical protocols can prove,
beyond a reasonable doubt, authenticity (the messages comes from the
source it mentions) and integrity (noone tampered with the message)
but it is not truth.

I can write a message "Dinosaurs never existed" and sign it with PGP,
it would not make it "the truth".

So, I suggest:

Authenticity : The fact that the data does indeed come from the source
it claims to come from. (It is strongly linked with Integrity, see below).

   stage it will fold in the work being done in the Methodology and
   Glossary drafts as well as the work being done in the case studies.
   It also folds in some of the text included in the original proposal
   for the HRPC.
