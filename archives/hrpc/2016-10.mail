A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Human Rights Protocol Considerations of the IETF.

        Title           : Research into Human Rights Protocol Considerations
        Authors         : Niels ten Oever

Abstract:
   This document provides a proposal for a vocabulary to discuss the
   relation between human rights and Internet protocols, an overview of
   the discussion in technical and academic literature and communities,
   a proposal for the mapping of the relation between human rights and
   technical concepts, and a proposal for guidelines for human rights
   considerations, similar to the work done on the guidelines for
   privacy considerations [RFC6973].

   This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is
   published for informational purposes.

   This document is a product of the Internet Research Task Force
   (IRTF).  The IRTF publishes the results of Internet-related research
   and development activities.  This documents aims to be a consensus
   document of the Human Rights Protocol Consideration Research Group of
   the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF).

Hi Stephen,

Thanks so much for this extremely thorough review. We've responded to
all your comments and offered some solutions or at least some arguments
why we did not think it was a problem. Responses inline, and a new
version can be found here:

We also spent a bit of time coming up with a reply, sorry if it took

Up to now we have been able to reach consensus on all points, so let's
not lower the bar!

I think this is actually quite an apt description of the research as it
has been done. After we managed to get this into a document I think it
would be great to come up with next steps for 5.3.2, such as bringing it
into the IETF.

Thank you for pointing this out. By architecture, in this text, we are
referring to the technical functioning of the Internet =E2=80=93 as it pe=
rtains
to the remit of the IETF. Would it be better if the first mention of the
word architecture came with the following clarification: =E2=80=98Interne=
t
architecture is a catch-all phrase. In order to ensure it does not ring
hollow we want to clarify what we mean by this term. Our definition is
partly based on the consensus understanding of the term architecture as
laid out in RFC RFC1958 section 2.1, which states: =E2=80=98Many members =
of the
Internet community would argue that there is no architecture, but only a
tradition, which was not written down for  the first 25 years (or at
least not by the IAB).  However, in very general terms, the community
believes that the goal is connectivity, the tool is the Internet
Protocol, and the intelligence is end-to-end rather than hidden in the
network. The current exponential growth of the network seems to show
that connectivity is its own reward, and is more valuable than any
individual application such as mail or the World-Wide Web.  This
connectivity requires technical cooperation between service providers,
and flourishes in the increasingly liberal and competitive commercial
telecommunications environment. The key to global connectivity is the
inter-networking layer.  The key to exploiting this layer over diverse
hardware providing global connectivity is the "end to end argument=E2=80=99=
=2E
Building on RFC1958 we hold that the word architecture, in the context
of the IETF, refers to all the protocols, procedures, processes and
their accompanying people and politics that go into ensuring the
Internet remains a medium for unfettered global connectivity.=E2=80=99 Wo=
uld
such a definition clarify our use of the word architecture sufficiently?

Additionally, we would like to push back a bit against the argument that
because there is no consensus in the IETF on what the term architecture
means, we cannot use it in the text. The IRTF should be the space where
we can push the boundaries on that discussion, bringing in definitions
from academia as we do in the text by referring to amongst others the
work of Prof. Denardis and Prof. Bowker on architecture.

The easy answer, which will probably will not be enough for you, would
be: depends on the usecase. If we for instance take the example of TLS
for .onion websites, there the security model includes anonymity as well
as authenticity.

I think it can easily be argued than in many models of security, privacy
and anonymity play a role, in others anonymity may be less important.

To reflect this I changed the text to:

A combination of reliability, confidentiality, integrity, anonymity, and
authenticity is what makes up security on the Internet.

I also changed the '=3D' in to an '=E2=87=92'

Where it come to the definition of rights in 5.2.2 the relation between
the LHS and the RHS should be 'contribute to an enabling environment
for', so I replaced the '=3D' with '=E2=87=92' and added an explanation.

The scope of this document is _very_ different from RFC3552. It analysis
a case of technology and it's impact human rights. So, it has a
completely different role from RFC3552, even though the conclusions are
largely the same.

We have had four people who did an exhaustive roadtest of the
questionnaire and used it on their draft in development. They presented
the outcomes at the session in Berlin and were also posted to the list.

The concept of balancing rights is not an easy one and there is also no
consensus in the law community about how this should be done. There are
many scholarly papers written about this, and I would large go with the
approach in the UN Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights. So
I would offer the following text:

    Human rights can be in conflict with each other, such as the right
to freedom of expression and the right to privacy. In such as case the
different affected rights need to be balanced. In order to do this it is
crucial that the rights impacts are clearly documented in order to
mitigate the potential harm in a proportional way. Making that process
tangible and practical for protocol developers is what this research
aims to ultimately contribute to.

Although there has been a lot of discussion on the extend to which human
rights were at the top of the minds of the people developing it, the
technical principles like end-to-end, decentralization etc which were
priorities for the initial developers overlap sufficiently with human
rights like freedom of speech and access to information to make this
argument stick. It might have been a happy accident, but few in the RG
have disputed that - when looking at it from this perspective - human
rights are not intrinsically weaved through the structure of the
network. We have specified our definition of Internet architecture to
mitigate your concerns there.

A little wish-fullthinking never hurt anyone I guess ;-) Incorporated
your suggestion at the end of the sentence  and changed 'enabled' to
'allowed' for.

We mean to say here that the nature of the Internet was fundamentally
open. People could just show up and hack away. Have changed the sentence
to read: The open nature of the initial technical design (open
standards, open source, etc) fostered freedom of communication as a core
value, everyone could join and everyone could submit code. Hope that
clarifies a bit. This was done to show that today's Internet is more
closed. Closed standards (and standards bodies) walled garden
applications etc.

Have changed the words ensuring and galvanizing for the word encourage.
And changed the word encourage in the second sentence to the word
facilitate. I understand that the IETF/IRTF does not ensure anything.
But to tone the language down all through the document would take away
from the fact that the IETF/IRTF does have a substantial role in setting
the standard (no pun intended) for what they think the network should
look like, irrespective of what implementers and operators end up doing.

OK - removed 'unfettered'.

Interesting. Happy to fix, but would be great if you could give me a bit
more to work with.

Anonymity has a very specific meaning in both legal and technical terms,
there I think it's important that we work on this. The UN Special
Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression has underlined the importance of
encryption and anonymity online (
http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/FreedomOpinion/Pages/CallForSubmission.asp=
x
). And eventhough it is indeed a hard technical problem, I actually
think quite a lot of people are working on this. Tor is indeed probably
the best 'running code' example, but there is also Briar, I2P, Tribler,
etc. There is also an  increase in Operating Systems that are geared
towards anonymity (by integrating Tor and other measures) such as
Subgraph, Tails, and Qubes, so I think discussing it is relevant, and I
don't think we should take a step back an accept that it's not possible.

Maybe it's not and maybe it should be. Because there is a clear human
rights impact here. The aforementioned report by the UNSR recognizes the
essential role of encryption and anonymity in realizing human rights
protected under international law, as such technology =E2=80=9Cprovide[s]=

individuals and groups with a zone of privacy online to hold opinions
and exercise freedom of expression without arbitrary and unlawful
interference or attacks.=E2=80=9D

I did not change this. Because although your statement on the delay of

definition of content agnosticism perse.

Here I would like to push back with the arguments Ramsey Nasser
introduced at his presentation at the hrpc session at IETF95. Based on
his programming language in Arabic he showed through 'engineering
performance art', that the Internet and its technical infrastructure is
inherently hostile to non latin characters, which send the message that
the Internet natively belongs to English speakers. This is true for
developers, operators and users alike imho.

There should have been a hard return there. The text is lifted from

The definition doesn't say access to all hosts, right? I don't think I

Added:
The right to privacy is articulated  all of the major international and
regional human rights instruments, including:
{{UDHR}} Article 12: =E2=80=9CNo one shall be subjected to arbitrary
interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to

References added (my bad, thanks for spotting) and offered grammtical
improvements for robustness:

: The resistance of protocols and their implementations to errors, and
to involuntary, legal or malicious attempts to disrupt its mode of
operations. {{RFC0760}} {{RFC0791}} {{RFC0793}} {{RFC1122}}. Or framed
more positively, robustness is the quality of a system that can provide
functionality consistently and without errors despite  involuntary,
legal or malicious attempts to disrupt its mode of operations.

Nopes - these were terms that kept returning in interviews and during

good point, added the following language to the text. In protocol design
ensuring for the capacity to both scale up and down can be a challenge.
Yet, it is important to consider the capability of the protocol to do
both, to ensure new protocols consider the requirements of both big and
small operators.

I want to push back a little on the fact that this is not RG consensus.
I think a lot of people have expressed the sentiment that their
technical protocols increasingly have an impact on the political realm
and vice-versa. As such protocols have become enveloped in politics,
whether we/the IETF/the technical community likes it or not. Not to
speak of the fact that many prominent academics, which include engineers
and computer scientists, underwrite this statement. I also do not think
it is without qualification, the text goes on to mention at least eight
different papers that carefully qualify these statements. If we however
write out there arguments we run the risk of making that bit of text
suffer from TL;DR.

These discussions have been had on the lists, in addition to the latest
session of hpc in Berlin when United Nations Special Rapporteur David
Kaye presented his latest report on the responsibility of SDOs vis-a-vis
human rights. The HRPC work has been focused specifically on the
question of how values get translated to design, and how they should or
should not. As such, I am surprised to hear you say that you have not
seen this happen on the list.

The full quote in the paper reads:  "The =E2=80=9Ctheory of the blunt
instrument=E2=80=9D says that if  you  can  blunt  the  tools  of  your
antagonist  in  a  tussle,  you  may be able to disable him. Thus, if
all users of the Internet always  encrypted  everything  they  sent,
there  could  be  no wiretaps and no discrimination based on content.
The only tool left to the regulator (e.g., the state) would be the blunt
instrument  of  total  disconnect.  This  theory  is  appealing  to
those  who  see  the  Internet  as  a vehicle for contention with state
controls.  And indeed, this theory is appealing and has much  to
recommend  it.  But  (again)  in  the  extreme,  it
suffers from two problems. First, we have seen states, faced with  the
only  option  of  the  blunt  instrument,  use  it.  When Google
refused  to  continue  to  comply  with  the  law  of  the land  in
China,  China  threatened  to  revoke  their  license  to operate
there,  leaving  Chinese  users  with  the  even
- more regulated  alternative  of  Baidu.  Opinions  may  differ,  but
some  argue  that  a  little  Google  would  be  better for the Chinese
people than none.
Similarly,  Burma  took  the  step  of disconnecting all international
telecommunications links during    the    2007    =E2=80=9CSaffron
Revolution=E2=80=9D,    and    several
countries  have  blocked  Facebook  and  YouTube.  Are  those countries
and  their  citizens  better  off  with  that  outcome than    with
half    a    loaf?    Second,    when    law    trumps technology,
baking the =E2=80=9Cblunt instrument=E2=80=9D outcome into the architectu=
re   may
raise   large   complexities   for   actors required to comply with
regulations. When France required that  Yahoo  block  auctions  of  Nazi
 memorabilia  to  its citizens,  Yahoo  had  to  organize  a  table
that  identified (imperfectly)  IP  addresses  of  French  users.  Would
 it  have been better or worse if the Internet made it easy to tell from
what jurisdiction a connection came?"

See here:
http://conferences.sigcomm.org/co-next/2010/Workshops/REARCH/ReArch_paper=
s/10-Brown.pdf

What they mean in this case is that if the IETF were to bake the UDHR
into its protocols, countries who do not agree with that might
completely withdraw from the standard setting process. I agree that
tools of enforcement is unclear so I changed that sentence to better
reflect that sentiment.

That thee is no scaled/robust network to compare against doesn't mean

What we're doing here is 'know and show' the human rights impacts of a
specific protocol, that this is the only solution that exists and works
today, doesn't mean that it doesn't have a specific impact.  So it's
about documenting of impacts. I don't think we're claiming anywhere that
those features could have been better, the sentence only reads that it
_can_ be done differently, not that that solution would be better.

I've also added a reference on source routing.

With NAT deployed all over we're also running out of IP addresses, so
not sure your critique holds. Mobility could have been an alternative
for NAT, not for IPv6 (or its other alternatives).

You mean that it is expensive to become a registry (starting from

Stephane has been so nice to provide text for this:

Users can switch to another resolver, for instance a public one such as
those operated by  Telecomix [http://dns.telecomix.org/]. The distorter
can then try to block or hijack the connection to this resolver. This
may start an arm's race, the user switching to secured connections to
this alternative resolver ({{RFC7858}}), the disruptor then trying to
find more sophisticated ways to block or hijack. In some cases, this
research to find an alternative, non-disrupting resolver, may lead to
more centralisation, many people going to a few big commercial public
resolvers.

I am not sure what this would add to this. It is not stated that there
was no debate or that there are no exclusive h2/tls implementation. Am

the the analysis of the impact of this protocol on human rights.

Do we really want to get into the Facebook Messenger, Ello, Telegram,

It's the first. The reason for adding this case category to the research
was that peer-to-peer got mentioned a lot in the interviews and in
discussions on this, so we thought it would be useful for the document
to discuss it here.

Removed 'is becoming and added:

    "While its most common application has traditionally been
file-sharing (and other types of content delivery systems), P2P is a
popular architecture for networks and applications that require (or
encourage) decentralization. A prime example is Bitcoin (and similar
cryptocurrencies), as well as Bitcoin and proprietary multimedia
applications."

I think the 'conclusion' para is pretty clear on this:

These platforms are not perfect, and more research needs to be done.
If adopted at large, well-designed and resistant P2P networks might
represent a critical component of a future secure and distributed
Internet, enabling freedom of speech and freedom of information at scale.=


I think that is not an implied argument for making everything P2P.

Not sure if I share your view. There are concrete threats, that we can
people to be cognizant of by thinking and documenting issues that could
arise, through the use of the questionnaire. I don't see how the use of

I've rewrote the section:

If your protocol impacts packet handling, does it look at the packet
payload? Does it look at Is it making decisions based on the payload of
the packet? Does your protocol prioritize certain content or services
over others in the routing process ? Is the protocol transparent about
the priotization that is made (if any)?

Not sure about this. That this is picked up in other IETF processes
doesn't mean it shouldn't be discussed here from the human rights angle.
Else also wouldn't need to discuss security, etc. Plus I think there is
ample reference to the existing IETF procedures hear to ensure that
there is no duplication of efforts.

I don't agree, especially since anonymity is such a concept that is both
legally and technically understood, but hard to achieve. And as you said
previously, the combination of protocols make anonymity harder, which is
actually a case to raise awareness about anonymity in all protocols.

I assume you think these two should be merged? I could be convinced of
that, but would that make it easier to understand? Or just for the sake
of making it shorter? I do not think this Research Draft necessarily
needs to be short because it outlines the full research. If we take this
work further we can have a closer look at usability and streamlining it
with other relevant reviews that are ongoing in the IETF, IESG, etc.

We have thought of BGP as one of the cases actually, and it is one that
I would love to to.

I do think it makes sense to put in some prioritization of human rights
impacts assessments in here though. I don't think core or non-core needs
to be binary as well. Some things are simply bound to be used more and
thus can have a bigger potential impact.

In the previous steps we have established that human rights relate to
standards and protocols and offered a common vocabulary of technical
concepts that impact human rights and how these technical concept can be
combined to ensure that the Internet remains an enabling environment for
human rights. With this the contours of a model for developing human
rights protocol considerations has taken shape. This subsection provides
the last step by detailing how specific technical concepts identified
above relate to human rights, and what questions engineers should ask
themselves when developing or improving protocols. In short, it presents
a set of human rights protocol considerations.

questionnaire.

But it is used in the slides of Bless and Orwat, that's why it's there.

What doesn't map out? I think the numbers have been extremely handy in
reviewing. If people share this opinion I can remove them at the end of

We cut the discussion up in the doc, but here it makes sense I'd say,
because it can concretely impact human rights.

Fixed.

I would prefer doing this in another document once this one is done.

Done.

Maybe you should take up that problem with

Hi all

I have started to edit via git but perhaps that's no longer helpful at
this stage? I was focussed on the abstract and introductions as those,
at a minimum, should have strong logical arguments that draw the reader
into the longer paper.

I also fully agree with Stephen about the DDoS section and if nothing
else would be happy to proceed with working on this.

However, fully aware that work needs to progress and without having been
able to comment up to now I'd like feedback on where in the text my
edits could be most useful.

    I have started to edit via git but perhaps that's no longer helpful

Overall, I think this is a fine piece of work and I look
forward to it becoming an RFC. I don't think it's nearly ready
yet though, there's a lot to fix. (But see #1 below for a
suggested short-cut.)

Cheers,
S.

General, and, I think, important to handle...

(1) What kind of consensus are we aiming for here?

I'm not sure if this would be better off aiming to be a
document that has RG consensus or not. There's a lot of fine
text here, but there's also quite a few instances of text for
which I think it may be quite hard to establish RG consensus,
and where that may take some time and draft iterations.
(You'll see some examples in my specific conments.) Clearly,
processing the document aiming for RG consensus is an option,
and maybe the default option, but I wondered if it'd also be an
option to proceed more quickly with this documenting the
author's research and opinions/conclusions (and not necessarily
RG consensus) and to then later try to extract an updated
version of the guidlines/questionnaire into a separate RFC
aiming for RG consensus. I'm not arguing strongly for that
latter plan but just wanted to ask in case it helps the RG (and
Avri who I guess will have the fun of figuring this out:-).

</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <pre wrap=3D"">
Up to now we have been able to reach consensus on all points, so let's

I think this is too long to be very useful for protocol
developers.  I doubt many of them will wade through 40+ pages
to get to the bit that's really aimed at them. (And which
pretty much needs a total re-write.) The plan mentioned in #1
might help there I guess but another idea might be to move
section 5.3.2 to the front and make a lot of the rest of the
text into subsequent explanatory material and/or appendices.

</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <pre wrap=3D"">
I think this is actually quite an apt description of the research as it
has been done. After we managed to get this into a document I think it
would be great to come up with next steps for 5.3.2, such as bringing it
into the IETF.


</pre>
      <blockquote type=3D"cite">
        <pre wrap=3D"">(3) What architecture do you mean?

There are 25 lines that mention the term architecture in the
draft and I'm not at all sure the term is used to mean the same
thing throughout.  I'm also not sure that there is an accepted
thing that is "the one true Internet architecture" that has
IETF consensus but you seem to me to be assuming that there is
such a beast. Is this just a language issue or a deep(er)
problem?  I'm not sure, but eliminating references to the
Internet architecture where possible would I think help.  See
some of the specific comments below, but I'd recommend a pass
over the document to check how this term is used as well.  (To
try head off some lines of debate that might follow from this
comment, I do think there are aspects of Internet architecture
for which we do have IETF consensus, but I don't think the IETF
has consensus on any one way in which to put all those together
into something that'd be rightly termed the (or an) Internet
architecture. I think RFC1958 section 2.1 supports that
position btw.)

</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <pre wrap=3D"">Thank you for pointing this out. By architecture, in=
 this text, we are
referring to the technical functioning of the Internet =E2=80=93 as it pe=
rtains
to the remit of the IETF. Would it be better if the first mention of the
word architecture came with the following clarification: =E2=80=98Interne=
t
architecture is a catch-all phrase. In order to ensure it does not ring
hollow we want to clarify what we mean by this term. Our definition is
partly based on the consensus understanding of the term architecture as
laid out in RFC RFC1958 section 2.1, which states: =E2=80=98Many members =
of the
Internet community would argue that there is no architecture, but only a
tradition, which was not written down for  the first 25 years (or at
least not by the IAB).  However, in very general terms, the community
believes that the goal is connectivity, the tool is the Internet
Protocol, and the intelligence is end-to-end rather than hidden in the
network. The current exponential growth of the network seems to show
that connectivity is its own reward, and is more valuable than any
individual application such as mail or the World-Wide Web.  This
connectivity requires technical cooperation between service providers,
and flourishes in the increasingly liberal and competitive commercial
telecommunications environment. The key to global connectivity is the
inter-networking layer.  The key to exploiting this layer over diverse
hardware providing global connectivity is the "end to end argument=E2=80=99=
=2E
Building on RFC1958 we hold that the word architecture, in the context
of the IETF, refers to all the protocols, procedures, processes and
their accompanying people and politics that go into ensuring the
Internet remains a medium for unfettered global connectivity.=E2=80=99 Wo=
uld
such a definition clarify our use of the word architecture sufficiently?

Additionally, we would like to push back a bit against the argument that
because there is no consensus in the IETF on what the term architecture
means, we cannot use it in the text. The IRTF should be the space where
we can push the boundaries on that discussion, bringing in definitions
from academia as we do in the text by referring to amongst others the
work of Prof. Denardis and Prof. Bowker on architecture.

        <pre wrap=3D"">(4) What does "=3D" mean here?

In section 2 and later (in 5.2.2) you have diagrams with
bracketed terms on the left, then "=3D" and then another term on
the right. I just don't get what you mean by that "=3D" sign. You
say "combine" and "makes up" but frankly I don't get it, even
though I was in some of the meetings where those pictures were
presented.  E.g. in section 2, I don't get how to combine
authenticity and anonymity in any useful sense, as those are
mostly in conflict.
</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <pre wrap=3D"">

The easy answer, which will probably will not be enough for you, would
be: depends on the usecase. If we for instance take the example of TLS
for .onion websites, there the security model includes anonymity as well
as authenticity.

I think it can easily be argued than in many models of security, privacy
and anonymity play a role, in others anonymity may be less important.

To reflect this I changed the text to:

A combination of reliability, confidentiality, integrity, anonymity, and
authenticity is what makes up security on the Internet.

I also changed the '=3D' in to an '=E2=87=92'


</pre>
      <blockquote type=3D"cite">
        <pre wrap=3D"">And the 2nd picture in section 2 has
connectivity on the RHS, which you defined as being an "extent"
and none of the things on the LHS seem to reflect that at all.
While those pictures may well have been ok for use in
presentations, I'm less happy that they're useful in an RFC.
So, what does "=3D" mean? Can you actually define that relation?
(Apologies if I'm being all "techie" and anal here, but I
really don't get it, honest;-)
</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <pre wrap=3D"">

Where it come to the definition of rights in 5.2.2 the relation between
the LHS and the RHS should be 'contribute to an enabling environment
for', so I replaced the '=3D' with '=E2=87=92' and added an explanation.

(5) The DDoS discussion is still wrong.

I think the discussion of DDoS in section 5.2.11 (see below for
specifics) is not good enough and that section needs to be
re-written or mostly deleted. (Not all list discussions need to
end up with a section in the document.) It may be the case that
what is needed is some discussion of forms of protest using the
Internet, but that I think would better be the topic for
another document, if soeone has the energy/interest. (That
could be interesting too!) For this document, if it is aimed at
the IETF audience, the current text is not useful as it ends up
as a (controversial) NOOP - "don't enable DoS" is already in
RFC3552 since 2003.

</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <pre wrap=3D"">
The scope of this document is _very_ different from RFC3552. It analysis
a case of technology and it's impact human rights. So, it has a
completely different role from RFC3552, even though the conclusions are
largely the same.

5.3.2.x.y: Please go through these questions yourself (for some

the questions.  I think a number of these questions will not
produce meaningful answers in any real attempt at using them.
I also think that someone who is not an author and who is
developing a new protocol needs to have gone through the
exercise at least once before we should publish this document
as any RFC. It is far too easy to ask unanswerable or
non-useful questions otherwise.

        <pre wrap=3D"">(7) Missing introductory text.

I think there's a missing bit of explanatory text about rights
in general that'd help some more IETF-oriented readers.  As I
understand it, in HR all rights are contingent in the sense
that governments are expected to balance competing rights in
all cases. So e.g. even though we have a right to life,
governments can legislate for capital punishment and still
consider themselves signed up to the UDHR. I think this is
worth noting, as for example, it means that we do not
necessarily want to enshrine all the fine concepts on which the
IETF has consensus as human rights, in particular, claiming
that one had a right to encrypt could as a side-effect allow
some governments to claim that they had a right to limit one's
knowledge of mathematics, if that is claimed to compete with

      <pre wrap=3D"">
The concept of balancing rights is not an easy one and there is also no
consensus in the law community about how this should be done. There are
many scholarly papers written about this, and I would large go with the
approach in the UN Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights. So
I would offer the following text:

    Human rights can be in conflict with each other, such as the right
to freedom of expression and the right to privacy. In such as case the
different affected rights need to be balanced. In order to do this it is
crucial that the rights impacts are clearly documented in order to
mitigate the potential harm in a proportional way. Making that process
tangible and practical for protocol developers is what this research
aims to ultimately contribute to.

Anonymity has a very specific meaning in both legal and technical terms,
there I think it's important that we work on this. The UN Special

encryption and anonymity online (
<a class=3D"moz-txt-link-freetext" href=3D"http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues=
/FreedomOpinion/Pages/CallForSubmission.aspx">http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Iss=
ues/FreedomOpinion/Pages/CallForSubmission.aspx</a>
). And eventhough it is indeed a hard technical problem, I actually
think quite a lot of people are working on this. Tor is indeed probably
the best 'running code' example, but there is also Briar, I2P, Tribler,
etc. There is also an  increase in Operating Systems that are geared
towards anonymity (by integrating Tor and other measures) such as
Subgraph, Tails, and Qubes, so I think discussing it is relevant, and I
don't think we should take a step back an accept that it's not possible.

all users of the Internet always  encrypted  everything  they  sent,
there  could  be  no wiretaps and no discrimination based on content.
The only tool left to the regulator (e.g., the state) would be the blunt
instrument  of  total  disconnect.  This  theory  is  appealing  to
those  who  see  the  Internet  as  a vehicle for contention with state
controls.  And indeed, this theory is appealing and has much  to
recommend  it.  But  (again)  in  the  extreme,  it
suffers from two problems. First, we have seen states, faced with  the

some  argue  that  a  little  Google  would  be  better for the Chinese

What they mean in this case is that if the IETF were to bake the UDHR
into its protocols, countries who do not agree with that might
completely withdraw from the standard setting process. I agree that
tools of enforcement is unclear so I changed that sentence to better
reflect that sentiment.

this alternative resolver ({{RFC7858}}), the disruptor then trying to
find more sophisticated ways to block or hijack. In some cases, this
research to find an alternative, non-disrupting resolver, may lead to
more centralisation, many people going to a few big commercial public

Hi Mallory,

Reviews and proposed edits (in the form of suggestions here on the list
and/or as pull request), are very welcome!

If you want to focus on the abstract and the introduction that would be
great, but of course feel free to look at other sections as well.

The latest version can always be found here:

https://github.com/nllz/IRTF-HRPC/blob/master/draft-research.md

Which is currently the same as:

https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-hrpc-research-01

Best,

I have started to edit via git but perhaps that's no longer helpful at
this stage? I was focussed on the abstract and introductions as those,
at a minimum, should have strong logical arguments that draw the reader
into the longer paper.

I also fully agree with Stephen about the DDoS section and if nothing
else would be happy to proceed with working on this.

However, fully aware that work needs to progress and without having been
able to comment up to now I'd like feedback on where in the text my

General, and, I think, important to handle...

(1) What kind of consensus are we aiming for here?

I'm not sure if this would be better off aiming to be a
document that has RG consensus or not. There's a lot of fine
text here, but there's also quite a few instances of text for
which I think it may be quite hard to establish RG consensus,
and where that may take some time and draft iterations.
(You'll see some examples in my specific conments.) Clearly,
processing the document aiming for RG consensus is an option,
and maybe the default option, but I wondered if it'd also be an
option to proceed more quickly with this documenting the
author's research and opinions/conclusions (and not necessarily
RG consensus) and to then later try to extract an updated
version of the guidlines/questionnaire into a separate RFC
aiming for RG consensus. I'm not arguing strongly for that
latter plan but just wanted to ask in case it helps the RG (and
Avri who I guess will have the fun of figuring this out:-).

I think this is too long to be very useful for protocol
developers.  I doubt many of them will wade through 40+ pages
to get to the bit that's really aimed at them. (And which
pretty much needs a total re-write.) The plan mentioned in #1
might help there I guess but another idea might be to move
section 5.3.2 to the front and make a lot of the rest of the
text into subsequent explanatory material and/or appendices.

            <pre wrap=3D"">(3) What architecture do you mean?

There are 25 lines that mention the term architecture in the
draft and I'm not at all sure the term is used to mean the same
thing throughout.  I'm also not sure that there is an accepted
thing that is "the one true Internet architecture" that has
IETF consensus but you seem to me to be assuming that there is
such a beast. Is this just a language issue or a deep(er)
problem?  I'm not sure, but eliminating references to the
Internet architecture where possible would I think help.  See
some of the specific comments below, but I'd recommend a pass
over the document to check how this term is used as well.  (To
try head off some lines of debate that might follow from this
comment, I do think there are aspects of Internet architecture
for which we do have IETF consensus, but I don't think the IETF
has consensus on any one way in which to put all those together
into something that'd be rightly termed the (or an) Internet
architecture. I think RFC1958 section 2.1 supports that
position btw.)

</pre>
          </blockquote>
          <pre wrap=3D"">Thank you for pointing this out. By architecture=
, in this text, we are
referring to the technical functioning of the Internet =E2=80=93 as it pe=
rtains
to the remit of the IETF. Would it be better if the first mention of the
word architecture came with the following clarification: =E2=80=98Interne=
t
architecture is a catch-all phrase. In order to ensure it does not ring
hollow we want to clarify what we mean by this term. Our definition is
partly based on the consensus understanding of the term architecture as
laid out in RFC RFC1958 section 2.1, which states: =E2=80=98Many members =
of the
Internet community would argue that there is no architecture, but only a
tradition, which was not written down for  the first 25 years (or at
least not by the IAB).  However, in very general terms, the community
believes that the goal is connectivity, the tool is the Internet
Protocol, and the intelligence is end-to-end rather than hidden in the
network. The current exponential growth of the network seems to show
that connectivity is its own reward, and is more valuable than any
individual application such as mail or the World-Wide Web.  This
connectivity requires technical cooperation between service providers,
and flourishes in the increasingly liberal and competitive commercial
telecommunications environment. The key to global connectivity is the
inter-networking layer.  The key to exploiting this layer over diverse
hardware providing global connectivity is the "end to end argument=E2=80=99=
=2E
Building on RFC1958 we hold that the word architecture, in the context
of the IETF, refers to all the protocols, procedures, processes and
their accompanying people and politics that go into ensuring the
Internet remains a medium for unfettered global connectivity.=E2=80=99 Wo=
uld
such a definition clarify our use of the word architecture sufficiently?

Additionally, we would like to push back a bit against the argument that
because there is no consensus in the IETF on what the term architecture
means, we cannot use it in the text. The IRTF should be the space where
we can push the boundaries on that discussion, bringing in definitions
from academia as we do in the text by referring to amongst others the
work of Prof. Denardis and Prof. Bowker on architecture.

            <pre wrap=3D"">(4) What does "=3D" mean here?

In section 2 and later (in 5.2.2) you have diagrams with
bracketed terms on the left, then "=3D" and then another term on
the right. I just don't get what you mean by that "=3D" sign. You
say "combine" and "makes up" but frankly I don't get it, even
though I was in some of the meetings where those pictures were
presented.  E.g. in section 2, I don't get how to combine
authenticity and anonymity in any useful sense, as those are
mostly in conflict.
</pre>
          </blockquote>
          <pre wrap=3D"">
The easy answer, which will probably will not be enough for you, would
be: depends on the usecase. If we for instance take the example of TLS
for .onion websites, there the security model includes anonymity as well
as authenticity.

I think it can easily be argued than in many models of security, privacy
and anonymity play a role, in others anonymity may be less important.

To reflect this I changed the text to:

A combination of reliability, confidentiality, integrity, anonymity, and
authenticity is what makes up security on the Internet.

I also changed the '=3D' in to an '=E2=87=92'


</pre>
          <blockquote type=3D"cite">
            <pre wrap=3D"">And the 2nd picture in section 2 has
connectivity on the RHS, which you defined as being an "extent"
and none of the things on the LHS seem to reflect that at all.
While those pictures may well have been ok for use in
presentations, I'm less happy that they're useful in an RFC.
So, what does "=3D" mean? Can you actually define that relation?
(Apologies if I'm being all "techie" and anal here, but I
really don't get it, honest;-)
</pre>
          </blockquote>
          <pre wrap=3D"">
Where it come to the definition of rights in 5.2.2 the relation between
the LHS and the RHS should be 'contribute to an enabling environment
for', so I replaced the '=3D' with '=E2=87=92' and added an explanation.

I think the discussion of DDoS in section 5.2.11 (see below for
specifics) is not good enough and that section needs to be
re-written or mostly deleted. (Not all list discussions need to
end up with a section in the document.) It may be the case that
what is needed is some discussion of forms of protest using the
Internet, but that I think would better be the topic for
another document, if soeone has the energy/interest. (That
could be interesting too!) For this document, if it is aimed at
the IETF audience, the current text is not useful as it ends up
as a (controversial) NOOP - "don't enable DoS" is already in
RFC3552 since 2003.

produce meaningful answers in any real attempt at using them.
I also think that someone who is not an author and who is
developing a new protocol needs to have gone through the
exercise at least once before we should publish this document
as any RFC. It is far too easy to ask unanswerable or
non-useful questions otherwise.

            <pre wrap=3D"">(7) Missing introductory text.

I think there's a missing bit of explanatory text about rights
in general that'd help some more IETF-oriented readers.  As I
understand it, in HR all rights are contingent in the sense
that governments are expected to balance competing rights in
all cases. So e.g. even though we have a right to life,
governments can legislate for capital punishment and still
consider themselves signed up to the UDHR. I think this is
worth noting, as for example, it means that we do not
necessarily want to enshrine all the fine concepts on which the
IETF has consensus as human rights, in particular, claiming
that one had a right to encrypt could as a side-effect allow
some governments to claim that they had a right to limit one's
knowledge of mathematics, if that is claimed to compete with
other rights (e.g. to safety). I'm not sure if this is the
right HRPC document to capture that, but it was a surprise for
me when I first found that out, so it may be worth adding a bit
of text explaining basic rights concepts like that here or
somewhere else.

</pre>
          </blockquote>
          <pre wrap=3D"">The concept of balancing rights is not an easy o=
ne and there is also no
consensus in the law community about how this should be done. There are
many scholarly papers written about this, and I would large go with the
approach in the UN Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights. So
I would offer the following text:

    Human rights can be in conflict with each other, such as the right
to freedom of expression and the right to privacy. In such as case the
different affected rights need to be balanced. In order to do this it is
crucial that the rights impacts are clearly documented in order to
mitigate the potential harm in a proportional way. Making that process
tangible and practical for protocol developers is what this research
aims to ultimately contribute to.

distinction that's mixed up in a few places in the document,
including in the next sentence - if the IRTF produces this RFC,
that's great and will help to ensure better realisation of HR

But to tone the language down all through the document would take away
from the fact that the IETF/IRTF does have a substantial role in setting
the standard (no pun intended) for what they think the network should

4084 section 1.2 says that it intentionally avoide pejorative

attention. I think following that guidance in this document
would be good. Most of the text is actually fine in this
respect, but an editing pass based on a review from some (as
yet uninvolved) protocol developers would be a good thing.  For
example, some of the references to companies and products later

          <pre wrap=3D"">Anonymity has a very specific meaning in both le=

). And eventhough it is indeed a hard technical problem, I actually
think quite a lot of people are working on this. Tor is indeed probably
the best 'running code' example, but there is also Briar, I2P, Tribler,
etc. There is also an  increase in Operating Systems that are geared
towards anonymity (by integrating Tor and other measures) such as
Subgraph, Tails, and Qubes, so I think discussing it is relevant, and I
don't think we should take a step back an accept that it's not possible.

          <pre wrap=3D"">The full quote in the paper reads:  "The =E2=80=9C=
theory of the blunt
instrument=E2=80=9D says that if  you  can  blunt  the  tools  of  your
antagonist  in  a  tussle,  you  may be able to disable him. Thus, if
all users of the Internet always  encrypted  everything  they  sent,
there  could  be  no wiretaps and no discrimination based on content.
The only tool left to the regulator (e.g., the state) would be the blunt
instrument  of  total  disconnect.  This  theory  is  appealing  to
those  who  see  the  Internet  as  a vehicle for contention with state
controls.  And indeed, this theory is appealing and has much  to
recommend  it.  But  (again)  in  the  extreme,  it
suffers from two problems. First, we have seen states, faced with  the
only  option  of  the  blunt  instrument,  use  it.  When Google
refused  to  continue  to  comply  with  the  law  of  the land  in
China,  China  threatened  to  revoke  their  license  to operate
there,  leaving  Chinese  users  with  the  even
- more regulated  alternative  of  Baidu.  Opinions  may  differ,  but
some  argue  that  a  little  Google  would  be  better for the Chinese
people than none.
Similarly,  Burma  took  the  step  of disconnecting all international
telecommunications links during    the    2007    =E2=80=9CSaffron
Revolution=E2=80=9D,    and    several
countries  have  blocked  Facebook  and  YouTube.  Are  those countries
and  their  citizens  better  off  with  that  outcome than    with
half    a    loaf?    Second,    when    law    trumps technology,
baking the =E2=80=9Cblunt instrument=E2=80=9D outcome into the architectu=
re   may
raise   large   complexities   for   actors required to comply with
regulations. When France required that  Yahoo  block  auctions  of  Nazi
 memorabilia  to  its citizens,  Yahoo  had  to  organize  a  table
that  identified (imperfectly)  IP  addresses  of  French  users.  Would
 it  have been better or worse if the Internet made it easy to tell from
what jurisdiction a connection came?"

What they mean in this case is that if the IETF were to bake the UDHR

completely withdraw from the standard setting process. I agree that

not have the feature that it allows deployments to limit
freedom of expression. So it may be that this feature/bug is
not IP specific but inherent in large networks. In any case,

devices mostly look deeper into the packet. That also seems to
be indicated when you talk about transports and spdy. I think
this section is confused about the differences between headers
at various layers, and our history of sending cleartext.  That
said, I could see that in future, as we encypt more Internet
traffic, someone may find rights-invading ways to use layer 3
headers but I'm not sure this is a significant issue today. (If
there is evidence of this being done, I'd be interested in
knowing about that. I guess there may be IPv6 options that are
in use like that or have been suggested but you don't cover

DPRIVE, then that creates a new threat of centralisation of
lots of queries (e.g. at 8.8.8.8) which introduces yet another

can then try to block or hijack the connection to this resolver. This
may start an arm's race, the user switching to secured connections to
this alternative resolver ({{RFC7858}}), the disruptor then trying to
find more sophisticated ways to block or hijack. In some cases, this
research to find an alternative, non-disrupting resolver, may lead to
more centralisation, many people going to a few big commercial public

I have started to edit via git but perhaps that's no longer helpful at
this stage? I was focussed on the abstract and introductions as those,
at a minimum, should have strong logical arguments that draw the reader
into the longer paper.

I also fully agree with Stephen about the DDoS section and if nothing

However, fully aware that work needs to progress and without having been

General, and, I think, important to handle...

(1) What kind of consensus are we aiming for here?

I'm not sure if this would be better off aiming to be a
document that has RG consensus or not. There's a lot of fine
text here, but there's also quite a few instances of text for
which I think it may be quite hard to establish RG consensus,
and where that may take some time and draft iterations.
(You'll see some examples in my specific conments.) Clearly,
processing the document aiming for RG consensus is an option,
and maybe the default option, but I wondered if it'd also be an
option to proceed more quickly with this documenting the
author's research and opinions/conclusions (and not necessarily
RG consensus) and to then later try to extract an updated
version of the guidlines/questionnaire into a separate RFC
aiming for RG consensus. I'm not arguing strongly for that
latter plan but just wanted to ask in case it helps the RG (and
Avri who I guess will have the fun of figuring this out:-).

I think this is too long to be very useful for protocol

to get to the bit that's really aimed at them. (And which
pretty much needs a total re-write.) The plan mentioned in #1
might help there I guess but another idea might be to move
section 5.3.2 to the front and make a lot of the rest of the

There are 25 lines that mention the term architecture in the
draft and I'm not at all sure the term is used to mean the same
thing throughout.  I'm also not sure that there is an accepted
thing that is "the one true Internet architecture" that has
IETF consensus but you seem to me to be assuming that there is
such a beast. Is this just a language issue or a deep(er)
problem?  I'm not sure, but eliminating references to the
Internet architecture where possible would I think help.  See
some of the specific comments below, but I'd recommend a pass
over the document to check how this term is used as well.  (To
try head off some lines of debate that might follow from this
comment, I do think there are aspects of Internet architecture
for which we do have IETF consensus, but I don't think the IETF
has consensus on any one way in which to put all those together
into something that'd be rightly termed the (or an) Internet
architecture. I think RFC1958 section 2.1 supports that
position btw.)

              </blockquote>
              <pre wrap=3D"">Thank you for pointing this out. By architec=
ture, in this text, we are
referring to the technical functioning of the Internet =E2=80=93 as it pe=
rtains
to the remit of the IETF. Would it be better if the first mention of the
word architecture came with the following clarification: =E2=80=98Interne=
t
architecture is a catch-all phrase. In order to ensure it does not ring
hollow we want to clarify what we mean by this term. Our definition is
partly based on the consensus understanding of the term architecture as
laid out in RFC RFC1958 section 2.1, which states: =E2=80=98Many members =
of the
Internet community would argue that there is no architecture, but only a
tradition, which was not written down for  the first 25 years (or at
least not by the IAB).  However, in very general terms, the community
believes that the goal is connectivity, the tool is the Internet
Protocol, and the intelligence is end-to-end rather than hidden in the
network. The current exponential growth of the network seems to show
that connectivity is its own reward, and is more valuable than any
individual application such as mail or the World-Wide Web.  This
connectivity requires technical cooperation between service providers,
and flourishes in the increasingly liberal and competitive commercial
telecommunications environment. The key to global connectivity is the
inter-networking layer.  The key to exploiting this layer over diverse
hardware providing global connectivity is the "end to end argument=E2=80=99=
=2E
Building on RFC1958 we hold that the word architecture, in the context
of the IETF, refers to all the protocols, procedures, processes and
their accompanying people and politics that go into ensuring the
Internet remains a medium for unfettered global connectivity.=E2=80=99 Wo=
uld
such a definition clarify our use of the word architecture sufficiently?

Additionally, we would like to push back a bit against the argument that
because there is no consensus in the IETF on what the term architecture
means, we cannot use it in the text. The IRTF should be the space where
we can push the boundaries on that discussion, bringing in definitions
from academia as we do in the text by referring to amongst others the
work of Prof. Denardis and Prof. Bowker on architecture.

In section 2 and later (in 5.2.2) you have diagrams with
bracketed terms on the left, then "=3D" and then another term on
the right. I just don't get what you mean by that "=3D" sign. You
say "combine" and "makes up" but frankly I don't get it, even
though I was in some of the meetings where those pictures were
presented.  E.g. in section 2, I don't get how to combine
authenticity and anonymity in any useful sense, as those are
mostly in conflict.

for .onion websites, there the security model includes anonymity as well
as authenticity.

I think it can easily be argued than in many models of security, privacy
and anonymity play a role, in others anonymity may be less important.

To reflect this I changed the text to:

A combination of reliability, confidentiality, integrity, anonymity, and
authenticity is what makes up security on the Internet.

I also changed the '=3D' in to an '=E2=87=92'

While those pictures may well have been ok for use in

So, what does "=3D" mean? Can you actually define that relation?

I think the discussion of DDoS in section 5.2.11 (see below for

re-written or mostly deleted. (Not all list discussions need to
end up with a section in the document.) It may be the case that
what is needed is some discussion of forms of protest using the

another document, if soeone has the energy/interest. (That
could be interesting too!) For this document, if it is aimed at
the IETF audience, the current text is not useful as it ends up
as a (controversial) NOOP - "don't enable DoS" is already in

I think there's a missing bit of explanatory text about rights
in general that'd help some more IETF-oriented readers.  As I
understand it, in HR all rights are contingent in the sense
that governments are expected to balance competing rights in
all cases. So e.g. even though we have a right to life,
governments can legislate for capital punishment and still
consider themselves signed up to the UDHR. I think this is
worth noting, as for example, it means that we do not
necessarily want to enshrine all the fine concepts on which the
IETF has consensus as human rights, in particular, claiming
that one had a right to encrypt could as a side-effect allow
some governments to claim that they had a right to limit one's
knowledge of mathematics, if that is claimed to compete with
other rights (e.g. to safety). I'm not sure if this is the
right HRPC document to capture that, but it was a surprise for
me when I first found that out, so it may be worth adding a bit
of text explaining basic rights concepts like that here or
somewhere else.

</pre>
              </blockquote>
              <pre wrap=3D"">The concept of balancing rights is not an ea=
sy one and there is also no
consensus in the law community about how this should be done. There are
many scholarly papers written about this, and I would large go with the
approach in the UN Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights. So
I would offer the following text:

    Human rights can be in conflict with each other, such as the right
to freedom of expression and the right to privacy. In such as case the
different affected rights need to be balanced. In order to do this it is
crucial that the rights impacts are clearly documented in order to
mitigate the potential harm in a proportional way. Making that process
tangible and practical for protocol developers is what this research
aims to ultimately contribute to.

4084 section 1.2 says that it intentionally avoide pejorative
terms so as to increase the likelihood that operators will pay
attention. I think following that guidance in this document
would be good. Most of the text is actually fine in this
respect, but an editing pass based on a review from some (as
yet uninvolved) protocol developers would be a good thing.  For
example, some of the references to companies and products later
on might raise hackles in a way that'd be counter productive.
Anyway, 4084 does not use the term unfettered at all so better
to not say that here.

              <pre wrap=3D"">Anonymity has a very specific meaning in bot=
h legal and technical terms,
there I think it's important that we work on this. The UN Special
Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression has underlined the importance of
encryption and anonymity online (
<a class=3D"moz-txt-link-freetext" href=3D"http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues=
/FreedomOpinion/Pages/CallForSubmission.aspx">http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Iss=
ues/FreedomOpinion/Pages/CallForSubmission.aspx</a>
). And eventhough it is indeed a hard technical problem, I actually
think quite a lot of people are working on this. Tor is indeed probably
the best 'running code' example, but there is also Briar, I2P, Tribler,
etc. There is also an  increase in Operating Systems that are geared
towards anonymity (by integrating Tor and other measures) such as
Subgraph, Tails, and Qubes, so I think discussing it is relevant, and I
don't think we should take a step back an accept that it's not possible.

              <pre wrap=3D"">The full quote in the paper reads:  "The =E2=
=80=9Ctheory of the blunt
instrument=E2=80=9D says that if  you  can  blunt  the  tools  of  your
antagonist  in  a  tussle,  you  may be able to disable him. Thus, if
all users of the Internet always  encrypted  everything  they  sent,
there  could  be  no wiretaps and no discrimination based on content.
The only tool left to the regulator (e.g., the state) would be the blunt
instrument  of  total  disconnect.  This  theory  is  appealing  to
those  who  see  the  Internet  as  a vehicle for contention with state
controls.  And indeed, this theory is appealing and has much  to
recommend  it.  But  (again)  in  the  extreme,  it
suffers from two problems. First, we have seen states, faced with  the
only  option  of  the  blunt  instrument,  use  it.  When Google
refused  to  continue  to  comply  with  the  law  of  the land  in
China,  China  threatened  to  revoke  their  license  to operate
there,  leaving  Chinese  users  with  the  even
- more regulated  alternative  of  Baidu.  Opinions  may  differ,  but
some  argue  that  a  little  Google  would  be  better for the Chinese
people than none.
Similarly,  Burma  took  the  step  of disconnecting all international
telecommunications links during    the    2007    =E2=80=9CSaffron
Revolution=E2=80=9D,    and    several
countries  have  blocked  Facebook  and  YouTube.  Are  those countries
and  their  citizens  better  off  with  that  outcome than    with
half    a    loaf?    Second,    when    law    trumps technology,
baking the =E2=80=9Cblunt instrument=E2=80=9D outcome into the architectu=
re   may
raise   large   complexities   for   actors required to comply with
regulations. When France required that  Yahoo  block  auctions  of  Nazi
 memorabilia  to  its citizens,  Yahoo  had  to  organize  a  table
that  identified (imperfectly)  IP  addresses  of  French  users.  Would
 it  have been better or worse if the Internet made it easy to tell from
what jurisdiction a connection came?"

What they mean in this case is that if the IETF were to bake the UDHR

completely withdraw from the standard setting process. I agree that

this section is confused about the differences between headers

DPRIVE, then that creates a new threat of centralisation of
lots of queries (e.g. at 8.8.8.8) which introduces yet another
point at which control can be enforced or where traffic can be

this alternative resolver ({{RFC7858}}), the disruptor then trying to
find more sophisticated ways to block or hijack. In some cases, this
research to find an alternative, non-disrupting resolver, may lead to
more centralisation, many people going to a few big commercial public

IMHO, it is more or less ready for a Last Call in this group. We do
not try to have an important protocol on the Standards Track, which
would require a perfect document. We are trying to document something
which was never explicit before, the fact that apparently technical
decisions have consequences for human rights. IMHO, this is more
important than trying to have a perfect RFC. I suggest we worked on it
long enough. Stephen Farrell's remarks
<https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/hrpc/H3AXTCsaiRywi9E0gFTWEP0Q5fc>
were good and interesting but I do not think they are a pre-requisite
for the Last Call.

However, I would be glad if some issues were really addressed. For
instance, I still do not find a clear definition of "public space"
(this is related to the dDoS discussion), despite
<https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/hrpc/YXQT6jWxSwngxiWNZG6spcrfjMM>,
the text about script encoding is still unclear despite

Hi,

Thanks to Niels & Corinne for the edited version.  I am still in the
process of reading the revision.

I too am inclined to start the RGLC real soon now, but wanted to give
people a chance to read and comment first.  Plan to take some sort of
action next week on this. I tend to believe that this is not something
we need to rush on, but also not something we should dally with.  And
while Stephen review is not a gating factor, it does seem appropriate
that his comments were responded to before moving on.

As for the issue you bring up, I assume you are not asking that the RG
deal with this before the RGLC.

thanks
avri

Great thanks. I'll respond only to the more general points in

Well, the RG has yet to produce any RFCs so I'm not clear
that there's a bar we're lowering or raising. In any case
this was just a suggestion for Avri to consider so we need
say no more.

Sorry, that's non-responsive to the main point: this is too
long and the bit that's important for the claimed audience
(IETFers) is buried at the end. I still suggest making that
structural change. Why not?

No, I think that's worse tbh, as will any attempt to define "the
Internet architecture" most likely. Others may disagree but I think
by far the best thing here is to remove as many uses of the term as
possible and to carefully say exactly what's meant in any remaining
cases (and I bet you'll find remaining cases mean different things).

Sorry, "pushing boundaries" is just fine, but one is not doing that
by using ill-defined terms in ill-defined ways. I also don't think
hrpc is a good venue for trying to define this particular term, nor
do I think such an activity is interesting or fruitful. Much better
to avoid use of the ill-defined term where it's not needed, which
is almost everywhere IMO.

No, the security model of TLS does not include anonymity. The security
model of Tor does. It's important to be precise like that I think in
this document. These uses of "=3D" or "=3D=3D=3D>" are nowhere near preci=
se IMO.

It can be argued yes. That argument is wrong where it comes to
anonymity which is a very very hard goal to even approach.

I think that is still plain wrong in multiple ways, but certainly
wrt anonymity.

Not using "=3D" is a minor editorial improvement.

TBH, I think those diagrams have outlived their usefulness and
could just be deleted or moved to an appendix only about the
method used in this work that does not claim that these relations
are well defined. (See also my point (2) above about structure.)

That is non-responsive to the main point here. The scope of

main point?

Can you send links to those please? I don't recall those as having
used the questions as listed but I may be mis-remembering. I still
find some of the questions non-useful for the intended audience
but of course I may be wrong or an outlier there.

I like that text, thanks. I'd suggest adding a bit of text to
cover what I think might be a misinterpretation that could be
common for the more literal-minded typical IETFer such as
myself:-) Something like:

"The fact that rights can always be in conflict with one another
means that all human rights are contingent and none are absolute.
So, for example, if one posited a "right to encrypt" as a human
right that inherently means accepting that there are times when
that "right" would lose out in balancing of conflicting rights.
That means that there are technical concepts (e.g. arithmetic,
the ability to write code), the free exercise of which may be
better protected if they are not specifically claimed as human
rights."

(As an aside, it's interesting that you are sensitive here to
the difficultly of establishing consensus on this topic, whereas
I am not. And then we reverse roles when it comes to "Internet
architecture." Not that surprising I guess:-)

>=20
>> Specific comments (without reference to importance:-)

Will get back to these later, when I get time.

Cheers,
S.

Personally, given the importance I find in this bit of work, I think the
greater value is in finding rough consensus, not in getting something
out quickly.  I think there are lots of ways to get research published,
and the value of an IRTF RFC is partly in the rough consensus it involves.

The question, though may involve finding out where the rough lies.  I
think the work needs wider exposure and it is possible that a RGLC may a
good way to determine that with a wider audience.  One of the things I
have noticed with my own work in RGs in the past, is that sometimes it
takes more than 1 RGLC to get to the rough consensus point, so assuming
that enough people think that a RGLC is warranted, it may be worth
calling one.

Still looking for more opinions, more feedback and more discussion on
the points Stephen is making.

Have been puzzling with this, removing public space seemed the easiest
way out, without getting into a new rabbit hole. What I have now is:


All of these issues seem to suggest that the IETF should try to ensure
that their protocols cannot be used for DDoS attacks, which is
consistent with the long-standing IETF consensus that DDoS is an attack
that protocols should mitigate them to the extent they can {{BCP72}}.
Decreasing the number of vulnerabilities in protocols and (outside of
IETF) the number of bugs in the network stacks of routers or computers
could address this issue. The IETF can clearly play a role in bringing
about some of these changes but the IETF cannot be expected to take a
positive stance on (specific) DDoS attacks, or create protocols to
enable some attacks and inhibit others. What the IETF can do is
critically reflect on its role in the development of the Internet, and
how this impacts the ability of people to excercise their human rights,
such as freedom of expression.

Would this work:

Does your protocol have text strings that have to be understood or
entered by humans? Does your protocol allow Unicode encoded in UTF-8
only? If other character sets or encodings are allowed, does your
protocol mandate a proper tagging of the charset? Did you have a look at
{{RFC6365}}?

Cheers,

Niels

Well, we're providing references to infrastructure scholars, so am not
so sure about ill-defined. Could you be a bit more precise in your
objection?

Why? Because anonymity is never part of any definition or concept of
security? That doesn't make sense to me.

I think they have a clear role in the methodology as described, and
therefore fit in this research document.

>=20

I thought I responded to your main point, could you else rephrase it? It
also rewrote it a bit, maybe that helps:

DDoS attacks can thus stifle freedom of expression, complicate the
ability of independent media and human rights organizations to exercise
their right to (online) freedom of association, while facilitating the
ability of governments to censor dissent.  When it comes to comparing
DDoS attacks to protests in offline life, it is important to remember
that only a limited number of DDoS attacks involved solely willing
participants. In most cases, the clients are hacked computers of
unrelated parties that have not consented to being part of a DDoS (for
exceptions see Operation Abibil {{Abibil}} or the Iranian Green Movement
DDoS {{GreenMovement}}). In addition, DDoS attacks are increasingly used
as an extortion tactic.



All of these issues seem to suggest that the IETF should try to ensure
that their protocols cannot be used for DDoS attacks, which is
consistent with the long-standing IETF consensus that DDoS is an attack
that protocols should mitigate them to the extent they can {{BCP72}}.
Decreasing the number of vulnerabilities in protocols and (outside of
IETF) the number of bugs in the network stacks of routers or computers
could address this issue. The IETF can clearly play a role in bringing
about some of these changes but the IETF cannot be expected to take a
positive stance on (specific) DDoS attacks, or create protocols to
enable some attacks and inhibit others. What the IETF can do is
critically reflect on its role in the development of the Internet, and
how this impacts the ability of people to excercise their human rights,
such as freedom of expression.

This is not true. Torture is for instance always prohibited. We would
get here into concepts of proportionality and necessity (and perhaps
even legal accountability), which would imho only make the text more,
not less complex for literal-minded types (and the non-literal-minded
types alike).

I see what you're trying to do here, but I think this is for another
document.

Well, there seems to be more consensus on Internet architecture than
this, at least as far as I could find, but am happy to be convinced (in
both cases).

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Human Rights Protocol Considerations of the IETF.

        Title           : Research into Human Rights Protocol Considerations
        Authors         : Niels ten Oever
                          Corinne Cath
	Filename        : draft-irtf-hrpc-research-02.txt
	Pages           : 68
	Date            : 2016-10-18

Abstract:
   This document provides a proposal for a vocabulary to discuss the
   relation between human rights and Internet protocols, an overview of
   the discussion in technical and academic literature and communities,
   a proposal for the mapping of the relation between human rights and
   technical concepts, and a proposal for guidelines for human rights
   considerations, similar to the work done on the guidelines for
   privacy considerations [RFC6973].

   This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is
   published for informational purposes.

   This document is a product of the Internet Research Task Force
   (IRTF).  The IRTF publishes the results of Internet-related research
   and development activities.  This documents aims to be a consensus
   document of the Human Rights Protocol Consideration Research Group of
   the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF).

Hmm. If that'd be an hrpc document then it'd fully
overlap with this. If not, then what kind of document
would that be? An IETF one? I think we're some way
from being ready for that tbh.

Anyway, doesn't that mean the comment stands for this
document? Producing another document doesn't answer
the point raised about the structure of this one.

Because I don't think it's likely an RG-consensus definition
of "Internet architecture" but even more important I think
this document doesn't have to depend on their being such a
consensus definition. (Just because there's a hole beside
us doesn't mean we need to dig it deeper:-)

More precise than "you don't need it, and you've not defined
it in a way that I think would garner consensus"? :-)

I'd again encourage you to try not use the term at all as it's
not needed.

I answered that above. Regardless of the symbol there's a
lack of precision in the concepts here but the presentation
implies that such precision exists. See the TLS/Tor text
just above.

I think we'd agree TLS is currently the most important
security protocol widely used on the Internet. TLS has
no concept of anonymity. Saying that "a,b,c, anonymity, e
and f is what makes up security on the Internet" is IMO
therefore wrong, for all a,b,c, e and f.

Another issue with "anonymity" is that it's not at all
clear what you might mean by that. Is the use of a source
IP address allowed? What about a MAC address? What about
identifiers in client certificates? What about a TLS
session ticket? And all of those are just TLS examples.

Any the "is what makes up" just seems like arm-waving.
I really am not seeing how we benefit from making such
ostensibly definitive (mis)statements. (While at the
same time being fine that such constructs were found
useful when organising the work earlier on.)

Yes, those may have been helpful in doing the work. That
does not mean it is helpful to present them as if they
are defining precise relationships, as they are not. Hence
my suggestion to move them to an appendix and present
them there as a tool that was used in the research and
not as (seems to me to be the case) as some results of
the work that define precise relationships.

Ok, fair enough, that is better.

I still think "limited number" and "in most cases" misrepresent
the reality though which is that maybe 99.999% of DDoS attacks
involve zombies.

I also don't think the linkage to freedom of expression survives
taking away the (bad) idea that some DDoS attacks are "ok."

Isn't the real problem with DDoS mitigation that it nearly forces
people to use commercial services, and not that DDoS mitigation
prevents people from saying what they want (e.g. protesting).

So I still think the above text could be improved but it's
no longer a show-stopper for me.

Quoting from that:

"

My own feeling is that while this checklist is helpful in the current
form, it should probably be shortened and clarified."

There Giovane said a bunch of the questions were not
relevant to him. (I'm not clear what the diference
between the two postings from his is btw, but that's
probably ok.)

Honestly, I'm not seeing "exhaustive," and I maintain my
position that a number of the questions won't have any good
answers for the intended audience.

This is probably old news but I agree that the diagrams have outlived
their usefulness... they draw the eyes, but then leave an interested
reader wondering what they are trying to depict. I like to be able to
describe the relationship described by a figure in words (even if
tortured!). Here, if I do that, I get:

Some combination of the concepts on the LHS support the concept on the RHS.

Can we just write that down in the draft for each figure? (If my
description above is right, I definitely think the figures can just be
removed in place of a table of concepts that interviewees listed as
relevant... no need for a mysterious figure).

best, Joe

FWIW, that's almost the same conclusion I reached wrt the
relationship that the symbol is trying to represent. It's
not clear to me that such statements are useful, hence my
suggestion to keep the pictures in an appendix as a bit of
methodology that was found useful, but that does not really
represent a result of the research.

Marco,

For those further interested in archeology, a little digging will find
the first traces of this in the RIPE DNS working group:

https://www.ripe.net/participate/mail/forum/dns-wg/PDIwMTYwNDIxMTUyNjQwLjJm=
ZmYwZjNjQHBhbGxhcy5ob21lLnRpbWUtdHJhdmVsbGVycy5vcmc+

I have no idea what "dig" will do on various systems. Don't try it as
root? ;)

Cheers,

Guys,

This discussion makes me think that there may be some interest in one thing that we are doing in Seoul (and of course, following on!)

We wanted to have a discussion in Seoul of "Deployment Challenges / Barriers to IDN - IEA" so that we could start documenting them and building a core group to carry on with this work.


This is an important issue for people who want to have email addresses in Hindi, Swahili, etc.  There is also much to discuss about the challenges of using domain names in non-English languages.

You may want to look at a draft that is the starting point of some of this work:


https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-elkchow-iea-deploy/?include_text=1
We will also be working on a document "Use Cases of Email Addresses".  Email addresses are used as "identities" in a number of instances.  For shopping, government, email lists, etc.  We may want to discuss this.

We plan to have a breakfast meeting at 8:00am Korea time on Thursday, November 17, 2016.  Remote access will be provided.


Please let me know if you are interested in participating in this discussion either live or remotely.  Replying to me unicast is just fine or on the list.  Whichever you prefer.

You may also wish to subscribe to the IMA@IETF.ORG email list, if you want to follow some of the discussions around these topics.

 
Thanks,

IETF one, and I think we're indeed still some time away from that.

And I think my point also still stands. It is logical to put=20
the conclusion of the research, after the research overview, at the=20
bottom. At least in a Research Document (which is what we're=20
developing here).

I am not sure if this point is widely shared. Would love to=20
hear from others. For me the way it is used does not seem=20
problematic. Perhaps you could point out more specifically where you=20
see problems (except in process)?

Pls show me how it is ill-defined, cause I do not see it. But this=20

OK - created a table as suggested by Joe and removed the formulas.=20

OK - so let's get a bit deeper into this. We're saying that security=20
is a human rights. We're not saying that encryption is a human=20
rights, only that encryption can enable a specific human right. That=20
is as far as we go here. I do not think that saying 'a specific=20
technology is a human right' makes much sense, because it is context=20
dependent. I do think privacy is a human rights and therefore we=20
should use encryption.  And that is the point we're making imho. But=20
maybe you see that differently?

I hope that with this we can now start the Research Group Last Call.

Cheers,

Niels

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Human Rights Protocol Considerations of the IETF.

        Title           : Research into Human Rights Protocol Considerations
        Authors         : Niels ten Oever
                          Corinne Cath
	Filename        : draft-irtf-hrpc-research-03.txt
	Pages           : 68
	Date            : 2016-10-23

Abstract:
   This document provides a proposal for a vocabulary to discuss the
   relation between human rights and Internet protocols, an overview of
   the discussion in technical and academic literature and communities,
   a proposal for the mapping of the relation between human rights and
   technical concepts, and a proposal for guidelines for human rights
   considerations, similar to the work done on the guidelines for
   privacy considerations [RFC6973].

   This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is
   published for informational purposes.

   This document is a product of the Internet Research Task Force
   (IRTF).  The IRTF publishes the results of Internet-related research
   and development activities.  This documents aims to be a consensus
   document of the Human Rights Protocol Consideration Research Group of
   the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF).

Many things are logical but unwise.

The length of this document and the target audience make
the current structure unwise.

I think in the above argument you also seem to be changing
the target audience a bit, moving from protocol developers
(IETFers) to those interested in reading about research.
Both are valid but very different target audiences.

Assuming there exists one true definition for the Internet
architecture is problematic. You already reference RFC1958
which says "The principle of constant change is perhaps the
only principle of the Internet that should survive indefinitely."
and which begins it's section 2.1 by saying "Many members of the
Internet community would argue that there is no architecture..."
While 1958 does go on to talk more about that (the that in
question being the topic of the RFC:-) I do not believe that
the core situation has changed over the last 20 years.

As to showing, I believe I did that in the original detailed
comments. (Would have to check though.)

I don't think that statement is in the draft. And while that
sentence may be one stated in various HR contexts, I don't
think that anyone has a good understanding of the mapping of
that to technical concepts that are meaningful to IETFers.
See the TLS/anonymity comments above.

Again. You don't currently say that in the draft. (And nor
should you I think.)

I think you're missing my point so I'll try again.

There is a risk that IETFers take a very literal approach to
the topic of considering human rights and as a result argue
that anything they consider "good" is a human right. This
draft should, I think, help avoid that by describing at least
one major pitfall in such an approach. And I think the example
of encryption is a good one to use for this.

I would put something easy to read at the top (like I'm doing in this email=
), such as the conclusions and list of rights, and save justifications and =
examples for later in the document.

My two cents,

Since you and Harry feel strongly about this, I will reconsider moving
the 'Model for developing human rights protocol considerations' up.

Do you think we should put them after the 'Vocabulary Used' and before
the 'Research Questions'?

What we have now is: "all the protocols, procedures, processes and their
accompanying people and politics that go into ensuring the Internet
remains a medium for unfettered global connectivity."

I think it makes sense to define it because then we can make the direct
relation between human rights and the Internet architecture. Which I
think is an important point to make.

You think it's too broad to be meaningful?

Does this solely apply to the security bit? Would you say that anonymity
is never a part of security?

Changed it into:

DDoS attacks can thus stifle freedom of expression, complicate the
ability of independent media and human rights organizations to exercise
their right to (online) freedom of association, while facilitating the
ability of governments to censor dissent.  When it comes to comparing
DDoS attacks to protests in offline life, it is important to remember
that only a limited number of DDoS attacks involved solely willing
participants. In the overwhelming majority of cases, the clients are
hacked hosts of unrelated parties that have not consented to being part
of a DDoS (for exceptions see Operation Abibil {{Abibil}} or the Iranian
Green Movement DDoS {{GreenMovement}}). In addition, DDoS attacks are
increasingly used as an extortion tactic.

Sorry I did not react to this, was still thinking about it actually.

Since the review of Shane and Giovane (and your comments) we cut a lot

That we do not fully understand it, does not mean we cannot say that
there is no relation, right? I think we are making a statement, just not
a conclusive one.

We should not say that encryption enables the right to privacy?

Are you saying that we should argue that there might be cases in which
encryption should not be used because of human rights considerations?

Hi all,

Unfortunately both our speakers for the hrpc session (Francesca Musiani
and Sarah Spiekerman) have canceled their presentation for the hrpc
session due to timezone constraints.

It would be great if others could help us suggest (and find) two other
speakers that could help us broaden our horizon and get a better
understanding of the relationship between human rights and standards in
specific and technology in general.

All suggestions would be appreciated.

Best,

Niels

Hi all,

Unfortunately both our speakers for the hrpc session (Francesca Musiani
and Sarah Spiekerman) have canceled their presentation for the hrpc
session due to timezone constraints.

It would be great if others could help us suggest (and find) two other
speakers that could help us broaden our horizon and get a better
understanding of the relationship between human rights and standards in
specific and technology in general.

All suggestions would be appreciated.

Best,

Niels

Hi,

I think that we could well spend the meeting discussing the remaining
open issues in draft-irtf-hrpc-research-03.txt.=20

I have avoided starting the last call because I do not think have have
reached a stable consensus point with the document, though I do see the
changes being made. I must admit that I still do not see consensus and
still do not hear enough voices to let me figure out where the rough is.

In prep I would like to build of list of still contentious points and
walk through them in the face to face situation.  Would that seem ok to
the rest of you?

thanks

avri

Yes. Replacing speakers with issue-resolution does sound a bit
more boring but much better use of f2f time;-)

I was too.  But there seem to still be unresolved issues, and I think
that we have to both have sufficient review in the RG and have settled
issues before going out for LC.  And while I know we can have multiple
LC, I think it is better to have something the group believes is ready
for publication before starting that first LC. 

The point of any all reviews is to improves the document. I think that
the pre LC conversations we are having now are helping to tighten the
draft and improve it.

RFC 5743 indicates that in the IRSG : "reviewers should assess whether
sufficient editorial and technical review has been conducted within the
RG and the requirements of this process document have been met, for
example, reviewers should evaluate whether the breadth of review the
document has received is adequate for the material at hand."

I want to make sure we meet that criteria before submitting it.

As the co-chair shepherding the doc in the RG, I have the honor of being
the 'bit more boring' co-chair. : )

All this being said, it would be great to have at least one speaker
with a modest slot (15-20m)... I've heard a few people (I think
Stephane was one of them) say that we "get different perspectives
about human rights issues in Asia when meetings are held there".

I probably have a very sparse set of contacts for human rights issues
in networking technologies based out of the Asian/ASEAN -- and those I
do have would probably be somewhat controversial. It would be great to
try and get someone who could speak to protocols and human rights and
then do the balance of the session in "bit more boring" mode. :)

best, Joe

Niels,

Might I suggest Professor Laura DeNardis, from American University. She's
not coming to the ICANN meeting, but can connect her in remotely if you are
interested.

Her email is - denardis@american.edu
