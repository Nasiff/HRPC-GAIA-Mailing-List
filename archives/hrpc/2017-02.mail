A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Human Rights Protocol Considerations of the IETF.

        Title           : Research into Human Rights Protocol Considerations
        Authors         : Niels ten Oever
                          Corinne Cath
	Filename        : draft-irtf-hrpc-research-09.txt
	Pages           : 72
	Date            : 2017-02-02

Abstract:
   This document aims to propose guidelines for human rights
   considerations, similar to the work done on the guidelines for
   privacy considerations [RFC6973].  This is achieved by providing a
   proposal for a vocabulary to discuss the relation between human
   rights and Internet protocols, an overview of the discussion in
   technical and academic literature and communities, a proposal for the
   mapping of the relation between human rights and technical concepts,
   as well as guidelines.

   If you want to see how to apply this work to your own, you can
   directly go to Section 6.  The rest of the document explains the
   background of the guidelines and how they were developed.

   This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is
   published for informational purposes.

   This document is a product of the Internet Research Task Force
   (IRTF).  The IRTF publishes the results of Internet-related research
   and development activities.  This documents aims to be a consensus
   document of the Human Rights Protocol Consideration Research Group of
   the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF).

This is a remarkable and remarkably useful document. 

My two comments/caveats are (and they both refer to Human Rights and the
UDHR) in general:
1. the report makes no reference and has no usefulness in the area of
"collective/group rights" as for example "the right to collective
bargaining", to "collective self-determination", to "collective expressions
of political opposition" (e.g. including those conducted on-line) except as
they can be parsed or reverted to "individual rights"--In a world going
crazier by the day with the strong likelihood that individual rights will be
increasingly difficult to maintain (and of less and less use in challenging
political authority) this strikes me as a significant gap although it was
clearly not what the work involved with this document was directed towards.

2. the report makes no reference and has no usefulness in the area of
"social justice" as for example in the economic (and social) distribution
effects of the Internet. Again with reference to the current political
situation, the Internet and those who have been developing it and driving it
(and who have systematically ignored (or derided) its social justice impact)
bare some responsibility for the political malformations that we are seeing
in several jurisdictions where the broad support of the Internet for
globalization was in no way matched by a concern for the localized
impacts of
globalization.  Again, of course this was clearly not what the work involved
with this document was directed towards.

I think that it is a pity that these two issues were not addressed and one
would hope that in any future efforts in these areas the very very
significant matters which collective rights and social justice raise not
only for the Internet but also for society in general will have a
significant priority.

But nevertheless I congratulate all those who worked on this document for
their very important efforts.

(And Avri you can take my comments as "review" as per your request.

Dear Avri,

That you very much for inviting comments.  I hope that you will take
into account my review below, even if some people think that I am
somewhat of a tech expert.

I have two overall comments, and some detailed comments, see below.

Best,
Richard
--------------------------------------------


1) Overall: introductory material
=================================

I find that the introductory part of the paper is influenced by what I
consider to be the old-fashioned view that "the Internet" is or should
be somehow immune from the rules that govern the rest of the world.  For
me, it has always been obvious that offline law applies equally online.

For example, it is not legitimate to argue that child abuse material
should be permitted on the Internet.  Yet that would be the consequence
of accepting a principle (cited in the introduction) such as  "There's a
freedom about the Internet: As long as we accept the rules of sending
packets around, we can send packets containing anything to anywhere."

Conversely, application of the long-standing rules governing the
confidentiality of physical mail to E-Mail would have avoided the
surveillance mess that we now face.  That is, if we recognize that
E-Mail is a modern equivalent of physical mail, and that offline law
applies equally online, then E-Mails could not be read by government
agencies without a court order based on probable cause.  Sadly, the
opposite is true in many countries.

2) Overall: focus on specific rights
====================================

The paper correctly notes that there are many human rights, but that not
all are relevant for ICTs. A partial catalog, with references to
sources, of human rights related to ICTs is at:

  http://www.apig.ch/UNIGE%20Catalog.pdf

While the RFC does mention rights other than freedom of speech and
privacy, it tends to focus on those particular rights.

I think that a more balanced approach would be better, and I will make
some specific suggestions.

3) Specific suggestions
=======================

Section 2
---------

Add the following definitions:

Democratic: Every citizen shall have the right and the opportunity to
take part in the conduct of public affairs, directly or through freely
chosen representatives (see art. 20 [ICCPR])

Living Standard: The right of everyone to an adequate standard of living
for himself and his family, including adequate food, clothing and
housing, and to the continuous improvement of living conditions (see
art. 11.1 [ICESCR])

Outcome Transparency: In this context outcome transparency is linked to
the comprehensibility of the effects of a protocol in relation to the
choices it makes for both user and protocol developers and implementers,
including the comprehensibility of possible unintended consequences of
protocol choices (e.g. lack of authenticity may lead to lack of
integrity and negative externalities)


Section 5.2.2, Figure 2
-----------------------

Add a new box:

First column: Transparency, Outcome Transparency, Connectivity,
Accessibility, Localization, Decentralization
Second column: Right to adequate standard of living

Section 6.1
-----------

Add a new penultimate paragraph, reading:

"A partial catalog of human rights related to ICTs, including economic
rights, is found in [HILL]."


Section 6.2
-----------

Add the following new sub-sections

6.2.19. Democratic

Question(s): Does your protocol infringe on, or weaken, the right of
every citizen to take part in the conduct of public affairs, directly or
through freely chosen representatives?

Explanation: certain protocols impose, de facto, policy choices, and
thus deprive citizens of the right to make those policy choices.

Example: a protocol that results in personal data being publicly
available deprives citizens of their right to make a policy that
protects personal data.


6.2.20. Living Standard

Question(s): Does your protocol infringe on, or weaken, directly or
indirectly, the right of everyone to an adequate standard of living for
himself and his family, including adequate food, clothing and housing,
and to the continuous improvement of living conditions?

Explanation: certain protocols can have dramatic effects on economic
conditions. This does not imply that the protocol should not be
developed or implemented, however, some consideration should be given to
the economic effects and how to deal with them.

Example: a protocol that automates the filing of briefs in court could
result in the unemployment of many court clerks. As a remedial measure,
it could be envisaged to train the concerned people so that they can
perform other tasks.

6.2.21. Outcome Transparency

Question(s): Are the effects of your protocol fully and easily
comprehensible, including with respect to unintended consequences of
protocol choices?

Explanation: certain technical choice may have unintended consequences.

Example: lack of authenticity may lead to lack of integrity and negative
externalities, of which spam is an example. Lack of data that could be
used for billing and accounting can lead to so-called "free"
arrangements which obscure the actual costs and distribution of the
costs, for example the barter arrangements that are commonly used for
Internet interconnection; and the commercial exploitation of private
data for targeted advertising which is the most common funding model for
the so-called "free" services such as search engines and social networks.

One additional detailed comment:

Section 6.1 contains the following statement: "A realistic example to
consider is when opposition group members (or those identified as such) in
totalitarian regimes are subjected to torture on the basis of information
gathered by the regime through information leakage in protocols."

Unfortunately it is not only totalitarian regimes that practice torture:
regimes that consider themselves to be democratic do so also.  And regimes
that consider themselves to be democratic engage in extrajudicial killing or
detention, see:

 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrajudicial_killing  

 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_detention  


So I suggest that the statement be reworded as follows:

"A realistic example to consider is when individuals identified as treats to
the state are subjected to torture or extrajudicial killing or detention on
the basis of information gathered by state agencies through information
leakage in protocols."

Best,
Richard

> Question(s): Does your protocol infringe on, or weaken, the right of

> indirectly, the right of everyone to an adequate standard of living for

Dear all,

At the IETF meeting in Seoul it was brought up we should further
investigate the topic of anonymity. Based on discussions I had with some
of you I set up a rough structure in this -00 draft.

I would be very interested to hear from you all whether this would be a
relevant and interesting angle that could contributed to our work. I
would also be very happy to co-author this with people who have more
knowledge on anonymity that I do, so feel free to volunteer and suggest
text.

Looking forward to discuss.

Best,

Niels

A new version of I-D, draft-tenoever-hrpc-anonymity-00.txt
has been successfully submitted by Niels ten Oever and posted to the
IETF repository.

Name:		draft-tenoever-hrpc-anonymity
Revision:	00
Title:		Anonymity, Human Rights and Internet Protocols
Document date:	2017-02-06

Abstract:
   Anonymity is less discussed topic in the IETF than for instance
   security [RFC3552] or privacy [RFC6973].  This can be attributed to
   the fact anonymity is a hard technical problem or that anonymizing
   user data is not of specific market interest.  It remains a fact that
   'most internet users would like to be anonymous online at least
   occasionally' [Pew].

   This document aims to break down the different meanings and
   implications of anonymity on a mediated computer network.

the work done at the HRPC group we have decided to focus our initial
efforts on first and second generation human rights. As much as we would
like to cover broader issues, at this point in time we have to limit the
scope of the research. We have also focused on individual rights as these
are clearly enshrined in globally recognized UN human rights documents,
like the ones you mention. Such broad documents are harder to come by for
group rights's issues. However, we will certainly consider your suggestions
for future work in this area.

=E2=80=8BAgain a very good point. However, much as we believe that social j=
ustice
issues are of equal importance as some of the things we cover we also
believe that the GAIA working group is better placed to cover the specific
issues you mentioned. And while social justice issues regularly overlap
with human right issues, considering the strong legal basis that exist for
understanding, and incorporating human rights in organizational processes
=E2=80=8Bthe focus of this research groups has been on the human rights.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Human Rights Protocol Considerations of the IETF.

        Title           : Research into Human Rights Protocol Considerations
        Authors         : Niels ten Oever
                          Corinne Cath
	Filename        : draft-irtf-hrpc-research-10.txt
	Pages           : 74
	Date            : 2017-02-08

Abstract:
   This document aims to propose guidelines for human rights
   considerations, similar to the work done on the guidelines for
   privacy considerations [RFC6973].  This is achieved by providing a
   proposal for a vocabulary to discuss the relation between human
   rights and Internet protocols, an overview of the discussion in
   technical and academic literature and communities, a proposal for the
   mapping of the relation between human rights and technical concepts,
   as well as guidelines.

   If you want to see how to apply this work to your own, you can
   directly go to Section 6.  The rest of the document explains the
   background of the guidelines and how they were developed.

   This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is
   published for informational purposes.

   This document is a product of the Internet Research Task Force
   (IRTF).  The IRTF publishes the results of Internet-related research
   and development activities.  This documents aims to be a consensus
   document of the Human Rights Protocol Consideration Research Group of
   the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF).

Hi,

Finally got through reviewing the latest draft and comments.  Apologies
for taking this long.  A lot to think about in those comments.

I also sent Neils and Corrine a copy with a bunch of typos marked,,
which I expect they will cover in -10

I believe that the latest version -09 has responded to most of the
comments and understand that -10, soon to come out will respond to
others.  At this point, I believe we have a document that has rough
consensus to move forward.

But, not all of the changes were trivial or editorial and thus will be
calling another LC, for 2 weeks this time, to give people a chance to
take another pass and make sure the the cumulative effect of the changes
really has rough consensus and that the group is roughly comfortable
with the way issues were resolved.

When the 2ndLC starts, I would also like to ask people to comment on
whether this should be a Informational or Experimental draft. Niels and
I differ on this, with both of us quoting the guidelines as argument. 
So would like to hear from others in the group.

For Informational (briefly) One reading say that if it not code the
experimented with it can't be experimental

For Experimental (briefly): this is just a first approximation at
Considerations for protocols and we would like to get feedback on
experimental use.

thanks

avri

I would prefer "Informational", since it is difficult to 'experiment' with
this.  It is just 'things to consider' when working on protocols.

Hi,

As mentioned in an earlier note, many changes were made to the draft in
response to comments made during the last last call. As these changes
were not just editorial, decided we needed another RGLC to review the
changes.

As of now starting a 2 weeks call on:

	Title           : Research into Human Rights Protocol Considerations
        Authors         : Niels ten Oever
                          Corinne Cath
	Filename        : draft-irtf-hrpc-research-10.txt
	Pages           : 74
	Date            : 2017-02-08

The call will end on Noon 1200 UTC 24 Feb 2017,

The IETF datatracker status page for this draft is:
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-hrpc-research/

There's also a htmlized version available at:
https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-hrpc-research-10

A diff from the previous version is available at:
https://www.ietf.org/rfcdiff?url2=3Ddraft-irtf-hrpc-research-10

Hello,

I just read through the "Research into Human Rights Protocol
Considerations" document. I have a few, relatively random, comments from
my read-through. (Apologies here -- I didn't have time to do a really
thorough review, and there were a few points about which I was slightly
uncomfortable or felt that the document neglected or, alternatively,
overemphasised. It seemed best not to let the perfect be the enemy of
the good, though, so am sending these comments along anyway.)

<Comments follow.>

Section 2:

* Censorship-resistance

Censorship has not yet been at this point defined -- that definition
should probably come in first. 

I also have a general problem with the political implications of 'censorship',
although I accept its widespread use. It might be nice to have the distinction
drawn between the technical terms such as 'filtering' and 'blocking', and the
more normatively-loaded term "censorship"?

Censorship is brought in later in this section as 'internet censorship'. I
would argue that you should harmonise the terms -- if you use 'internet
censorship' and not just 'censorship' then you should also use 'internet
censorship resistance'. 

I can see that this definition is partially taken from Elahi and
Goldberg, but what is this 'relevant for decision making' element? Is
suppression of, say, works of art not censorship by this definition?
(For that matter, is removal of child pornography not 'censorship'? This
is precisely why I prefer terms such as 'filtering'.)

* Strong encryption 

I checked the referenced RFC, but didn't see this definition of 'a large amount
of computing power'. I would argue that modern usage of 'strong encryption'
implies an amount of computing power infeasible even for major state-level
actors. (If implemented correctly.)

5.2.3.2.2

Maybe add 'overblocking' to the definitions list?

For DNS, maybe distinguish between 'fake response' (incorrect IP) and 'no
response' (nxdomain -- claiming that no such site exists).

5.2.3.5.1

This is an integrity issue, and integrity is not mentioned in this paragraph.
(Also, this feels like it's moving beyond a 'standards' issue? I'm not sure if
this is really falling within scope.)

As a side note, the inclusion of XMPP around this section of the document here
feels a little arbitrary -- especially the amount of the document devoted to
it.

5.2.3.5.2

You might want to mention the case of Iran throttling HTTPS connections,
causing users to switch to (unthrottled) HTTP to enable surveillance. I've kind
of lost track of the levels of subsections, though, so that may not be
appropriate here if you're focusing on p2p. (It would be elsewhere, though, as
the general issue of affordances is probably worth talking about -- if people
don't use the secure/rights-defending tools due to other constraints, such as a
lack of usability, then they have little impact.)

6.2.10

I would say "Pseudonymity -- the ability to use a persistent identifier not
linked to one's offline identity" straight away over simply 'disguise one's
identity', as 'disguise' is more easily confused with anonymity. 

I would also include consideration that pseudonyms cannot be simply reverse
engineered -- some early approaches simply took approaches such as simple
hashing of IP addreses. These could then be simply reversed by generating a
hash for each potential IP address and comparing it to the pseudonym.

6.2.14

I would draw a distinction between 'random degradation' and 'malicious
degradation'. Many current attacks against TLS, for example, exploit TLS's
ability to gracefully degrade to older cipher suites -- from  a functional
perspective, this is good. From a security perspective, this can be very bad.

<End of comments>

As I said, apologies for not being more thorough.

I flicked quickly through this but I didn't give it a
full read-through. With so much change I hope someone does
do that, but I don't have time right now sorry. As always
(sorry:-) I have a few comments:

- Abstract:

I hate >1 para abstracts. It also seems wrong at this point
for the document to say that it "aims to be a consensus
document" - but maybe the intent was to change that to
"this represents RG consensus" after Avri calls the result
of the 2nd LC? (And I still do think it's a mistake to aim
for that in any case, but I'm not objecting to it.)

- section 4:

This bit needs fixing: "if the IETF were to bake the UDHR
into its protocols, countries who do not agree with that
might completely withdraw from the standard setting process."
Countries do not participate in the IETF's process so this
makes no sense. I'd also not like s/countries/people from
countries/ as that assumes all a country's citizens agree
with something at once. I'd delete that argument, reducing
to three arguments, which is enough.

- later in section 4:

"Our position is..." I'm not at all sure that's appropriate
language for a document that claims to have rough consensus.
I'm also not at all sure that the rest of that para does in
fact represent rough consensus of the RG.

My conclusion from the list discussion and from the above
is that I'm supportive of this being published. That'll be
better as an informational RFC, as otherwise we may waste
time debating "so what's the experiment exactly" which'd
be a bit pointless in this case.

Cheers,
S.

Hi all,

I would like to see what people are thinking about the hrpc session for
Chicago. The speakers that were planned for the last session, but could
not make it due to time difference are still very willing to join us. To
refresh your memories, they are:

- Franscesca Musiani - on Infrastructure and Human Rights
https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/fmusiani
https://www.linkedin.com/in/francesca-musiani-b643667
https://twitter.com/franmusiani

- Sarah Spiekerman on Value Based Design
https://www.wu.ac.at/ec/team/sarah-spiekermann/
who is also working on the P7000 standard on Addressing Ethical Concerns
During System Design in the IEEE
http://standards.ieee.org/news/2016/ieee_p7000.html

both are based in Europe, and engaged towards the end of the week, so
this would mean we should ask for a morning session on Monday, Tuesday
or Wednesday, which I hope would not pose a problem with you all.

Other agenda topics could be:
- draft-tenoever-hrpc-anonymity-00

- Maybe a -00 version of a draft on freedom of association

- an update (and perhaps discussion) on the status of
draft-irtf-hrpc-research

Do people have other points for the agenda they would like to suggest?
Or speaker for the current or next session? New drafts? Discussion topics=
?

Currently we have the following conflicts: dnsops, saag, openpgp and of
course irtfopen. If others have other pressing conflicts, please let us
know.

All the best,

Niels

=E2=80=8BWe have added the following three definitions to draft:

Blocking: the practice of preventing access to resources in the
aggregate {{RFC 7754}}. Both blocking and filtering can be implemented
at the level of "services" (web hosting or video streaming, for example)
or at the level of particular "content."  {{RFC 7754}}

https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7754

Censorship: technical mechanisms, that include both blocking and
filtering, that certain political or private actors around the world use
to block or degrade Internet traffic. For further details on the various
elements of Internet censorship see {{Hall2016}}

https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hall-censorship-tech-04

Filtering: the practice of preventing access to specific resources
within an aggregate {{RFC 7754}}.

=E2=80=8BAgreed - however, we hope that the newly added definitions based=
 on
existing IETF drafts and documents clarify that in this particular case,
censorship does not come with a normatively loaded backpack, but rather
is seen as an umbrella term for filtering and blocking.=E2=80=8B

the narrow technical definition of censorship. =E2=80=8B

=E2=80=8BUpdated the language. It now reads:

Strong encryption / cryptography
Used to describe a cryptographic algorithm that would require a large
amount of computational power to defeat it [RFC4949]. In the modern
usage of the definition 'strong encryption' this refers to an amount of
computing power current not available, not even to major state-level
actors.

Changed the sentence into:

A notable instance of distortion occurred in Greece {{ververis}}, where
a study found evidence of both of deep packet inspection to distort DNS
replies, and more excessive blocking of content than was legally
required or requested (also known as overblocking)

This is part of the case studies is showing the relation between human

Added the following text to the analysis of HTTP and HTTPS (TLS):

While this is commendable, we must not lose track of the fact that
different protocols, implementations, configurations and networking
paradigms can intersect such that they (can be used to) adversely impact
human rights. For instance, certain countries will throttle HTTPS
connections forcing users to switch to the (unthrottled) HTTP to
facilitate surveillance {{Aryanetall}}.

>=20

=E2=80=8BUpdated the definition. It now reads: Pseudonymity - the ability=
 to use
a persistent identifier not linked to one's offline identity" straight
away - is an important feature for many end-users, as it allows them
different degrees of disguised identity and privacy online.=E2=80=8B

>=20

Update the language, it now reads:

Designing a standard that exposes private information, it is important
to consider ways to mitigate the obvious impacts. While pseudonyms
cannot be simply reverse engineered - some early approaches simply took
approaches such as simple hashing of IP addreses, these could then be
simply reversed by generating a hash for each potential IP address and
comparing it to the pseudonym - limiting the exposure of private
information remains important.

>=20

=E2=80=8BAdded two new bits to 6.2.14:
Under Explanation:

It is important here to draw a distinction between random degradation
and malicious degradation. Many current attacks against TLS, for
example, exploit TLS's ability to gracefully degrade to older cipher
suites -- from  a functional perspective, this is good. From a security
perspective, this can be very bad.=E2=80=8B

=E2=80=8BAlso added the following question:

Can your protocol resist malicious degradation attempts?=E2=80=8B

=E2=80=8BNo apologies - this was very thorough and we thoroughly apprecia=
te it.

Best,

Do you mean we should delete the hard return between these paras?:

This document aims to propose guidelines for human rights
considerations, similar to the work done on the guidelines for privacy
considerations {{RFC6973}}. This is achieved by providing a proposal for
a vocabulary to discuss the relation between human rights and Internet
protocols, an overview of the discussion in technical and academic
literature and communities, a proposal for the mapping of the relation
between human rights and technical concepts, as well as guidelines.



If you want to see how to apply this work to your own, you can directly
go to <xref
target=3D"model-for-developing-human-rights-protocol-considerations" />.
The rest of the document explains the background of the guidelines and
how they were developed.

I think it adds to readability and giving people what they need, but if
you feel strongly....

The rest of the abstract is mostly boilerplate text, merging that with
the above doesn't seem very useful to me.

OK - removed.

You think this does not represent the rough consensus of the RG ? This
has been in here for quite a while, and I haven't heard many people
arguing against this position:

=2E.. hard-coding human rights into protocols is complicated and changes
with the context. At this point is difficult to say whether hard-coding
human rights into protocols is wise or feasible.

Well, you could, but I meant more that I think abstracts should
be a *short* one paragraph description of the content. I don't
think you end up with that by merging these paragraphs.

IOW, please synopsize harder:-)

That said, this is just a style thing.

See below wrt the text that follows this phrase...

The "Our position is..." phrase is problematic regardless.

If the rest of the para does represent RG consensus then
there's no need for the problematic phrase. You could
delete it, or s/Our/The RG's/ and it'd be ok.

If the rest of the para does not represent RG consensus
then I'm not sure why the authors' divergent opinions are
being presented, and if they are, it'd be better to be
clearer about that position not being part of the RG
consensus. And to also be as clear if there are any other
similar bits of text. (And it'd probably be good to be
consistently clear in how that's done too:-)

The rest of that paragraph is much longer than that. And yes,
I'm not convinced that all of the rest of that para does
represent RG consensus, for example the last sentence which
says:

  "In addition, it
   ensures that the impact of specific protocol on human rights is
   carefully considered and that concrete design decisions are
   documented in the protocol."

I'd be surprised if that "ensures" was widely accepted. I
don't buy it anyway;-)

While this specific point isn't mega-important, since it's
fairly obvious that we can't often "ensure" stuff like this
gets done, I'm raising it as it could be indicative of
two relatively new to the process authors not quite getting
how RG consensus ought be reflected in a draft that claims
to represent the RG consensus. (And yes, apologies for not
raising this before.)

Note that I'm not accusing you guys of anything here, (we
have an odd process, and this is an odd document even in
that odd process, and this bit of text is an even odder
corner case in that pile of oddity;-) but if there are
other bits of text that you think represent your opinion
but not the RG consensus (or where Avri thinks that) then
it'd be good to call those out in some consistent and
very clear manner, or to remove the text. I haven't gone
through the whole doc looking for that kind of text and
I'm not sure if anyone else has. My feeble excuse for not
having done that is that as I said before I think this'd
have been better not aiming to be an RG consensus document:-)
And I'm willing to believe you/Avri if told that you had a
look and there are in fact no other bits of text like that.

If this turns out to be the only bit of text like this,
then I'd also wonder if it's really worth including.

Cheers,
S.

PS: I don't recall another IRTF RG consensus draft that
had bits of text representing the authors' non-consensus
opinions, but maybe someone else does in which case whatever
was done before could be copied. I'd be fine with us following
a precedent like that. If we're setting one here though,
then I'd prefer we try set a precedent that this kind of
thing ought be called out clearly and consistently.

Hi all,

I was pointed to http://potaka.io/, a programming language in Bengal (you c=
an read more about it here: https://globalvoices.org/2016/08/30/theres-fina=
lly-a-programming-language-in-bengali-script-thanks-to-potaka/ ). We had qu=
ite an interesting discussion about Internationalization, protocols and pro=
gramming languages with Ramsey Nasser at our Buenos Aires session based on =
the Arabic programming language he created. We also discussed this in point=
 6.2.5 of draft-irtf-hrpc-research. Is this a topic we want to dig into dee=
per, and perhaps get more IETF Internationalization people involved in the =
discussion?

Happy to discuss.

Best,

Niels

I think you _are_ right. What about this:

This document aims to propose guidelines for human rights
considerations, similar to the work done on the guidelines for privacy
considerations {{RFC6973}}. If you want to apply this work to your own,
you can directly go to <xref
target=3D"model-for-developing-human-rights-protocol-considerations" />.
The rest of the document explains the background of the guidelines and
how they were developed.

The RG was meant all the time, so I indeed changed in into 'RG's'.

Changed into:

In addition, it contributes to the careful consideration of the impact
that a specific protocol might have on human rights and that concrete
design decisions are documented in the protocol.

>=20

I hope it's fixed, and I don't think there are any diverging views
between RG and authors in the dock, and I also think there is no
language left that implies that. But always happy to address unclarities
of course.

Thanks for being patient with these two
relatively-new-to-the-process-authors :)

Cheers,

Niels

Hi,

Well

> Noon 1200 UTC 24 Feb 2017
has come and gone.

There were a few comments, but they seem to have been resolved. I have
asked Niels to hold off releasing the modified version until the last
call ended.  I would like to ask him to wait until tomorrow just in case
there are any last comments that are straggling in.

But the last call is essentially ended.

Thanks all for participating in this call.

Next week I will work on the required steps in moving this forward to
the IRSG &c. as a Research Group consensus doc, unless there are
objections. If there are any such objections, please let the list know
and please be specific about the problem and about how it should be fixed.

Thanks

avri

Hi Niels,

> Or speaker for the current or next session? New drafts? Discussion topics?

We have a report that may be in the interest of the WG.
We show how the hosting industry has reacted to efforts of the
community/industry to make encryption easier.

We show that once costs and complexity are removed, big players are
prone to deploy, in bulk, encryption across large number of sites,
enabling encryption in sites and domains that would otherwise be left
behind. The lessons learned can be also be generalized to other
security-related issues.

(I have also submitted this to MAPRG,but the agenda is still being defined).

Title: No domain left behind: is Let's Encrypt democratizing encryption?

Full paper at: https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03005 PDF:
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.03005v1

Summary: The 2013 National Security Agency revelations of pervasive
monitoring have lead to an "encryption rush" across the computer and
Internet industry. To push back against massive surveillance and protect
users privacy, vendors, hosting and cloud providers have widely deployed
encryption on their hardware, communication links, and applications. As
a consequence, the most of web traffic nowadays is encrypted. However,
there is still a significant part of Internet traffic that is not
encrypted. It has been argued that both costs and complexity associated
with obtaining and deploying X.509 certificates are major barriers for
widespread encryption, since these certificates are required to
established encrypted connections. To address these issues, the
Electronic Frontier Foundation, Mozilla Foundation, and the University
of Michigan have set up Let's Encrypt (LE), a certificate authority that
provides both free X.509 certificates and software that automates the
deployment of these certificates. In this paper, we investigate if LE
has been successful in democratizing encryption: we analyze certificate
issuance in the first year of LE and show from various perspectives that
LE adoption has an upward trend and it is in fact being successful in
covering the lower-cost end of the hosting market.

Hi,

Also it is obvious that I am the one in the rough on Informational vs
experimental, so not recommending any change in that regard.

Abstract

There is a growing literature revolving around the role of non-State actors=
 in the international law-making process. The starting point of this articl=
e is that although informal international law-making may not be legally bin=
ding, it would be unwise to dismiss it as legally irrelevant. Informal law-=
making can be relevant with respect to conceptualising and applying existin=
g law, as well as guiding future regulation. The present discussion is plac=
ed in the context of cyberspace and, more specifically, the Internet standa=
rdisation bodies=E2=80=99 informal law-making functions when creating Inter=
net protocols by setting Internet standards. The article addresses the legi=
timacy and the ongoing work of the Internet Advisory Board and Internet Eng=
ineering Task Force in setting Internet standards with the aim to protect I=
nternet users from mass surveillance and serious threats to privacy online.=
 The article makes two main arguments. First, the effective protection of o=
nline privacy cannot be understood only in terms of compliance with legal f=
rameworks but =E2=80=93 in practice =E2=80=93 that also needs to be secured=
 through technological means. Second, in the area of online privacy informa=
l law-making and international law converge in a distinctive way. Internet =
standards should not necessarily be seen as =E2=80=9Cliving a parallel life=
=E2=80=9D to law or as displacing or merely complementing the law. Technica=
l standards and international law can actively inform one another and conve=
rge in their application. The analysis explores the implications of the Int=
ernet=E2=80=99s technical features to policy-making and legal reasoning by =
discussing State and judicial practice. The article demonstrates how the te=
chnical perspective on privacy informs and enriches the manner in which the=
 legal advisor argues about privacy, the legislator articulates the interes=
ts at stake and the judge and practitioner interpret and apply internationa=
l human rights law.=20

Best,
