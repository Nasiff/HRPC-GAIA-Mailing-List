Hi All,

A belated introduction from me, but an opportunity to wish you all a successful
New Year.

I serve on the IESG as one of the two Routing Area Directors.

I have a history of trying to increase participation in the IETF from a wider
set of countries and people as well as trying to get the IETF to focus more on
technologies that address the needs of a broad set of users not just the
super-connected Western few. I helped found ISOCs policy fellow programme that
seeks to bring regulators and policy-makers from around the world to experience
and participate in IETF meetings.

My responsibilities within the IETF include the MANET and ROLL working groups
that develop routing protocols for ad hoc and lossy networks.

Looking forward to the next steps!

Adrian

Hi All,

Happy New Year!

I am Eiko Yoneki from the Computer Laboratory at the University of
Cambridge. I  have worked on multi-point communication in P2P, MANET and
DTN/Opportunistic networks. Previously, I spent several years with IBM in US
developing various networking products. 

I am currently interested in building inexpensive opportunistic networks in
rural/developing countries (e.g. Congo in Africa) using small devices (e.g.
Raspberry Pi) connecting through the satellite to developed countries.  

Cheers, Eiko

Dear All,
  Happy New Year!

During the holidays, it was a privilege to get a few more members
including the commonwealth telecommunications organisations.

Just to kickstart an initial discussion:

There has been significant focus on new edge access technologies with
all the promising white space initiatives especially with Microsoft
and Google showing a keen interest in these technologies:

http://google-africa.blogspot.de/2013/11/trial-in-cape-town-shows-that-tv-w=
hite.html
http://www.microsoft.com/africa/4afrika/white_spaces_project.aspx

And folks from Berkeley on GSM whitespaces:
http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2013/EECS-2013-198.pdf

Its great to know that there is much wider acceptance and expectations
on newer access tech to deliver its promises because of all the known
challenges faced by existing access tech.

So this naturally raises an important question: There has been
significant amount of work done on new Internet architectures for e.g
Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) and Information Centric Networking
(ICN).There has been some proven evidence how such technologies could
reduce cost of Internet access especially on how DTN could be used for
time-shifting content during off-peak hours reducing costs
significantly..

=93Delay Tolerant Bulk Data Transfers on the Internet=93, N. Laoutaris, G.
Smaragdakis, P. Rodriguez, R. Sundaram, in ACM/SIGMETRICS=9209.

With all the issues with power and power accounting for 50% of OPEX
for rural networks
(http://www.itu-apt.org/gtas11/green-solutions.pdf), should'nt we
start trialling out new Internet architectures that move away from the
traditional "always-on" model to "almost always off" mode which calls
for the need to bring in tech like DTN and ICN. It is absolutely
encouraging to see that there seems to be an infrastructural thinking
in this direction:
https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/nsdi13/nsdi13-final182.pdf

Infact ICN has other proven benefits:

(i)  the publish/subscribe approach reduces bandwidth wastage ( why do
we need to PUSH all the heavy long tailed videos to the cloud - just
publish metadata and based on interest, push the data on demand? This
applies for all the other OSN content sharing..)

(ii) And the other inherent edge caching benefits for localised access
(infact the Google cache initiatives in Africa is encouraging:
http://www.tnj.com/career/people-move/googles-ory-okolloh-working-access-an=
d-transparency-sub-saharan-africa)


So my question to all: Is this the right moment to start deploying and
trialling out these new Internet architectures? Yay or Nay?

 If Yay: Are there any planned initiatives? If so, what would be the challe=
nges?

If Nay:  Would just getting an access infrastructure (and all the
other logistics that come with it) to a community would be sufficient?

Regards
Arjuna

      <pre wrap=3D"">Dear All,
  Happy New Year!

During the holidays, it was a privilege to get a few more members
including the commonwealth telecommunications organisations.

Just to kickstart an initial discussion:

There has been significant focus on new edge access technologies with
all the promising white space initiatives especially with Microsoft
and Google showing a keen interest in these technologies:

<a class=3D"moz-txt-link-freetext" href=3D"http://google-africa.blogspot.=
de/2013/11/trial-in-cape-town-shows-that-tv-white.html">http://google-afr=
ica.blogspot.de/2013/11/trial-in-cape-town-shows-that-tv-white.html</a>
<a class=3D"moz-txt-link-freetext" href=3D"http://www.microsoft.com/afric=
a/4afrika/white_spaces_project.aspx">http://www.microsoft.com/africa/4afr=
ika/white_spaces_project.aspx</a>

And folks from Berkeley on GSM whitespaces:
<a class=3D"moz-txt-link-freetext" href=3D"http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/P=
ubs/TechRpts/2013/EECS-2013-198.pdf">http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/Te=
chRpts/2013/EECS-2013-198.pdf</a>

Its great to know that there is much wider acceptance and expectations
on newer access tech to deliver its promises because of all the known
challenges faced by existing access tech.

So this naturally raises an important question: There has been
significant amount of work done on new Internet architectures for e.g
Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) and Information Centric Networking
(ICN).There has been some proven evidence how such technologies could
reduce cost of Internet access especially on how DTN could be used for
time-shifting content during off-peak hours reducing costs
significantly..

=93Delay Tolerant Bulk Data Transfers on the Internet=93, N. Laoutaris, G=
=2E
Smaragdakis, P. Rodriguez, R. Sundaram, in ACM/SIGMETRICS=9209.

With all the issues with power and power accounting for 50% of OPEX
for rural networks
(<a class=3D"moz-txt-link-freetext" href=3D"http://www.itu-apt.org/gtas11=
/green-solutions.pdf">http://www.itu-apt.org/gtas11/green-solutions.pdf</=
a>), should'nt we
start trialling out new Internet architectures that move away from the
traditional "always-on" model to "almost always off" mode which calls
for the need to bring in tech like DTN and ICN. It is absolutely
encouraging to see that there seems to be an infrastructural thinking
in this direction:
<a class=3D"moz-txt-link-freetext" href=3D"https://www.usenix.org/system/=
files/conference/nsdi13/nsdi13-final182.pdf">https://www.usenix.org/syste=
m/files/conference/nsdi13/nsdi13-final182.pdf</a>

Infact ICN has other proven benefits:

(i)  the publish/subscribe approach reduces bandwidth wastage ( why do
we need to PUSH all the heavy long tailed videos to the cloud - just
publish metadata and based on interest, push the data on demand? This
applies for all the other OSN content sharing..)

Arjuna & Adam,

I'm a little bit cautious to jump into a technologically-driven
discussion. I feel that it is more important to ask what it is that we
believe where the "current way the Internet works" (some might interpret
that as 'the current Internet architecture') falls short in providing
universal access in an economically feasible way. Otherwise, we might
look like a group of people who are looking for solutions that would fit
their technologies.=20

If we indeed turn to shortfalls, I think that a good starting point
might lie in the question of what the constraints are. These constraints
can be 'architectural limits' (as Adam expressed it) or simply
'operational limits' (driven by either policy or/and economic
interests).=20

For instance, if we look at service-level latency as a constraint, we
could argue that generally there is nothing wrong with the current
architecture as it is, unless we define that latency low enough. Today's
answer to such low bound for the constraint are CDNs and clever ways of
'breaking the E2E' perception of the connection to serve content closer
to the user. End of discussion? Possibly, unless we introduce another
constraint, say efficiency. Said aforementioned 'clever' ways come at
the cost of DPI, DNS tricks, ..., all of which introduce an ICN-ish
notion to the end user but based on a location-dependent underlay.
Whether or not such approach (which is the current Internet approach) is
sustainable all depends on your constraints for latency as well as
efficiency.=20

>From these core constraints, we can derive many others (such as economic
metrics such as OPEX). The question, in the context of GAIA, is which
markets are suitable for certain ranges of constraints and where do we
have 'black spots' (i.e., constraints currently not sufficiently served
by the current technologies). While the non-black spots are still
interesting to me (e.g., to improve efficiency of ICT systems in
developed markets), the black spots are interesting for us here, I
believe, in particular when hoping that new fancy developments of recent
years, such as DTN and ICN, could change the picture in terms of
removing 'black spots' over an agreed range for agreed constraints.
However, I don't think that the community at large has no systematic
understanding of these constraints, the range of them, and the black
spots in terms of markets (beyond the anecdotal work in many projects).=20

Best,

Dirk
P.S.: BTW, I used to think that the question of ICN or DTN being a good
idea ought to be driven by answering the question "what can they do I
can't do in the current Internet?" After years of ICN research, I came
to believe that there's little you can do (in ICN) that you can't do in
the current Internet - if you assume that you can throw any engineering
effort into it and that efficiency does not matter. GAIA, to me, is a
group of people that knows from experience that efficiency and therefore
affordability does matter in the end, and we sometimes have to get
inventive to push the boundaries of what's currently possible - even by
re-thinking architectural foundations.

Subject: [gaia] Time for exploring new Internet architectures?

Dear All,
  Happy New Year!

During the holidays, it was a privilege to get a few more members
including the commonwealth telecommunications organisations.

Just to kickstart an initial discussion:

There has been significant focus on new edge access technologies with
all the promising white space initiatives especially with Microsoft and
Google showing a keen interest in these technologies:

http://google-africa.blogspot.de/2013/11/trial-in-cape-town-shows-that-t
v-white.html
http://www.microsoft.com/africa/4afrika/white_spaces_project.aspx

And folks from Berkeley on GSM whitespaces:
http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2013/EECS-2013-198.pdf

Its great to know that there is much wider acceptance and expectations
on newer access tech to deliver its promises because of all the known
challenges faced by existing access tech.

So this naturally raises an important question: There has been
significant amount of work done on new Internet architectures for e.g
Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) and Information Centric Networking
(ICN).There has been some proven evidence how such technologies could
reduce cost of Internet access especially on how DTN could be used for
time-shifting content during off-peak hours reducing costs
significantly..

"Delay Tolerant Bulk Data Transfers on the Internet", N. Laoutaris, G.
Smaragdakis, P. Rodriguez, R. Sundaram, in ACM/SIGMETRICS'09.

With all the issues with power and power accounting for 50% of OPEX for
rural networks (http://www.itu-apt.org/gtas11/green-solutions.pdf),
should'nt we start trialling out new Internet architectures that move
away from the traditional "always-on" model to "almost always off" mode
which calls for the need to bring in tech like DTN and ICN. It is
absolutely encouraging to see that there seems to be an infrastructural
thinking in this direction:
https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/nsdi13/nsdi13-final182.pd
f

Infact ICN has other proven benefits:

(i)  the publish/subscribe approach reduces bandwidth wastage ( why do
we need to PUSH all the heavy long tailed videos to the cloud - just
publish metadata and based on interest, push the data on demand? This
applies for all the other OSN content sharing..)

(ii) And the other inherent edge caching benefits for localised access
(infact the Google cache initiatives in Africa is encouraging:
http://www.tnj.com/career/people-move/googles-ory-okolloh-working-access
-and-transparency-sub-saharan-africa)


So my question to all: Is this the right moment to start deploying and
trialling out these new Internet architectures? Yay or Nay?

 If Yay: Are there any planned initiatives? If so, what would be the
challenges?

If Nay:  Would just getting an access infrastructure (and all the other
logistics that come with it) to a community would be sufficient?

Regards
Arjuna

I don't want to pre-judge anything we talk about, but it would be nice to
have more folks here with stories from the coal face of challenging
deployments in the wild - what works and what doesn't and what was
surprising about why and why not - that could drive the selection of
problems to tackle, whether operational, standards, or
research/architectural...

one lesson from usability research is that if you make something more
usable for people (like me, with hearing and sight problems) you make them
even more usable for everyone else -

I suspect that if we tackle the high bar to deploy, manage and sustain an
Internet Service (relative to the disposable income in parts of the world
we're discussing), we may find something that will be equally (or even
more) of interest to the commercial outfits in the G20 etc...

this may turn out to be just nailing how to plug 'n play very very big
systems (so lessons for Internet of Things will also be useful) - so a
single engineer call out for a broadband provider in the UK is said to wipe
out the margin of profit for that customer for a year - imagine a world
where we each have a 5000 devices - so the call out rate could be 1000
times higher, or we need to scale fault free system operation UP by 1000
times - another way to put this is that in developing world, we need to
scale down costs of managing internet access by around 1000 times.

that seems like a climbable mountain....steep, but not impossible:)

happy new year

cheers
jon

      <pre>Dear All,
  Happy New Year!

During the holidays, it was a privilege to get a few more members
including the commonwealth telecommunications organisations.

Just to kickstart an initial discussion:

There has been significant focus on new edge access technologies with
all the promising white space initiatives especially with Microsoft
and Google showing a keen interest in these technologies:

<a href=3D"http://google-africa.blogspot.de/2013/11/trial-in-cape-town-show=
s-that-tv-white.html" target=3D"_blank">http://google-africa.blogspot.de/20=
13/11/trial-in-cape-town-shows-that-tv-white.html</a>
<a href=3D"http://www.microsoft.com/africa/4afrika/white_spaces_project.asp=
x" target=3D"_blank">http://www.microsoft.com/africa/4afrika/white_spaces_p=
roject.aspx</a>

And folks from Berkeley on GSM whitespaces:
<a href=3D"http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2013/EECS-2013-198.pd=
f" target=3D"_blank">http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2013/EECS-2=
013-198.pdf</a>

Its great to know that there is much wider acceptance and expectations
on newer access tech to deliver its promises because of all the known
challenges faced by existing access tech.

So this naturally raises an important question: There has been
significant amount of work done on new Internet architectures for e.g
Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) and Information Centric Networking
(ICN).There has been some proven evidence how such technologies could
reduce cost of Internet access especially on how DTN could be used for
time-shifting content during off-peak hours reducing costs
significantly..

=93Delay Tolerant Bulk Data Transfers on the Internet=93, N. Laoutaris, G.
Smaragdakis, P. Rodriguez, R. Sundaram, in ACM/SIGMETRICS=9209.

With all the issues with power and power accounting for 50% of OPEX
for rural networks
(<a href=3D"http://www.itu-apt.org/gtas11/green-solutions.pdf" target=3D"_b=
lank">http://www.itu-apt.org/gtas11/green-solutions.pdf</a>), should&#39;nt=
 we
start trialling out new Internet architectures that move away from the
traditional &quot;always-on&quot; model to &quot;almost always off&quot; mo=
de which calls
for the need to bring in tech like DTN and ICN. It is absolutely
encouraging to see that there seems to be an infrastructural thinking
in this direction:
<a href=3D"https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/nsdi13/nsdi13-fin=
al182.pdf" target=3D"_blank">https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference=
/nsdi13/nsdi13-final182.pdf</a>

Infact ICN has other proven benefits:

(i)  the publish/subscribe approach reduces bandwidth wastage ( why do
we need to PUSH all the heavy long tailed videos to the cloud - just
publish metadata and based on interest, push the data on demand? This
applies for all the other OSN content sharing..)

(ii) And the other inherent edge caching benefits for localised access
(infact the Google cache initiatives in Africa is encouraging:
<a href=3D"http://www.tnj.com/career/people-move/googles-ory-okolloh-workin=
g-access-and-transparency-sub-saharan-africa" target=3D"_blank">http://www.=
tnj.com/career/people-move/googles-ory-okolloh-working-access-and-transpare=
ncy-sub-saharan-africa</a>)


So my question to all: Is this the right moment to start deploying and
trialling out these new Internet architectures? Yay or Nay?

 If Yay: Are there any planned initiatives? If so, what would be the challe=
nges?

If Nay:  Would just getting an access infrastructure (and all the
other logistics that come with it) to a community would be sufficient?

Regards
Arjuna

Thanks for sharing this article.  The GSMA say basically the same
thing in the 2013 UNESCO Broadband Commission's State of Broadband
Report (http://www.broadbandcommission.org/).  I view this as a sign
of progress.  The GSMA completely ignored white spaces in the 2012
report (along with WiFi).  The fact that they are now attempting to
spread FUD about it is a sign of the traction that it is gaining.

Their position is disingenuous.  They continue to project the myth
that gaining access to more spectrum is going to address emerging
demand for broadband when it is clear that the real gains are going to
be made from smaller cell sizes.

They also paint a false picture of white spaces interfering with the
emerging 700MHz and 800MHz IMT bands, whereas 470MHz to 698MHz offers
plenty of scope for access.

Finally, while spectrum harmonisation is a laudable general goal, to
be so dismissive of dynamic spectrum approaches is to ignore what is
IMO an inevitable technological solution to what is currently a
massive administrative/game theoretic roadblock.

Unfortunately, as an industry mouthpiece, the GSMA have a
disproportionate amount of sway in institutions like the ITU and with
development agencies as well.

See the the final presentation from Francois Rancy of the ITU from
this ITU Regional Radiocommunication Seminar for Arab
Countries,Tunisia, 9-13 Dec 2013
(http://www.itu.int/oth/R0C06000056/en) where he essentially echoes
the GSMA position.

We need the likes of Microsoft, Google, and Facebook weighing in in
these fora to balance the rhetoric a little :)

Cheers... Steve

Thanks for your replies..

Ofcourse there is no single uniform solution to solve across the
entire spectrum of challenges. It is mandatory for us to understand
the entire gamut of the challenges faced in enabling universal access
and to scope out where, how and which technologies could help. This
may include reusing existing tech, re-engineering existing tech or
pushing the boundaries to rethink new architectural foundations to
solve the problems.

I am hoping GAIA will be a platform to achieve this goal. I am
optimistic that we will have more input from the other members on this
list who have significant deployment experiences.

I am wondering whether it would be a worthwhile option to have an IAB
workshop on this in a developing region?

We already have a Dagstuhl seminar planned on this topic:

Hi all,

I can contribute a few lessons learned from building Village Telco (
http://villagetelco.org) as a social enterprise over the last couple of
years.

1/  WiFi is undervalued in emerging markets as complementary
infrastructure.  In the industrialised world, we see the role that WiFi is
playing in terms of data offload.  See
http://www.nielsen.com/uk/en/insights/press-room/2012/wi-fi-delivers-over-t=
hree-quarters-of-all-uk-smartphone-data.htmlor
http://www.mobidia.com/products/analytics/  In emerging markets, WiFi is
rarely mentioned as a strategic technology.  It would be nice to see
national broadband plans acknowledging the role of unlicensed spectrum as
that might lead to a change in point 2.

2/  ISM band regulation is far from normalised across countries.  We assume
that WiFi is legal everywhere but the truth is the regulation of WiFi
(point-to-point in particular) is pretty inconsistent.  In Zimbabwe, use of
ISM bands for point-to-point connections is not illegal but a license is
required and the regulator (POTRAZ) has decided not to give out any
licenses in the ISM bands.  In Malawi, point-to-point WiFi is legal but
attracts a USD1000 fee per year; a pretty steep hurdle for a small
entrepreneur.  There is space for an advocacy campaign just around making
the ISM bands more accessible, not to mention increasing unlicensed
spectrum in the 5GHz band.

3/  Last and most important, mechanisms for entrepreneurs are key.  Simple
billing systems that tie into local mobile money solutions could really
help WiFi take off in emerging markets.  This is where we failed with
Village Telco.  We focused too much on devices and simplifying deployment
when we should have placed equal or arguably more emphasis on simple
billing solutions.  Management systems are important too but billing is
first prize.

Regards... Steve

      <pre>Dear All,
  Happy New Year!

During the holidays, it was a privilege to get a few more members
including the commonwealth telecommunications organisations.

Just to kickstart an initial discussion:

There has been significant focus on new edge access technologies with
all the promising white space initiatives especially with Microsoft
and Google showing a keen interest in these technologies:

<a href=3D"http://google-africa.blogspot.de/2013/11/trial-in-cape-town-show=
s-that-tv-white.html" target=3D"_blank">http://google-africa.blogspot.de/20=
13/11/trial-in-cape-town-shows-that-tv-white.html</a>
<a href=3D"http://www.microsoft.com/africa/4afrika/white_spaces_project.asp=
x" target=3D"_blank">http://www.microsoft.com/africa/4afrika/white_spaces_p=
roject.aspx</a>

And folks from Berkeley on GSM whitespaces:
<a href=3D"http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2013/EECS-2013-198.pd=
f" target=3D"_blank">http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2013/EECS-2=
013-198.pdf</a>

Its great to know that there is much wider acceptance and expectations
on newer access tech to deliver its promises because of all the known
challenges faced by existing access tech.

So this naturally raises an important question: There has been
significant amount of work done on new Internet architectures for e.g
Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) and Information Centric Networking
(ICN).There has been some proven evidence how such technologies could
reduce cost of Internet access especially on how DTN could be used for
time-shifting content during off-peak hours reducing costs
significantly..

=93Delay Tolerant Bulk Data Transfers on the Internet=93, N. Laoutaris, G.
Smaragdakis, P. Rodriguez, R. Sundaram, in ACM/SIGMETRICS=9209.

With all the issues with power and power accounting for 50% of OPEX
for rural networks
(<a href=3D"http://www.itu-apt.org/gtas11/green-solutions.pdf" target=3D"_b=
lank">http://www.itu-apt.org/gtas11/green-solutions.pdf</a>), should&#39;nt=
 we
start trialling out new Internet architectures that move away from the
traditional &quot;always-on&quot; model to &quot;almost always off&quot; mo=
de which calls
for the need to bring in tech like DTN and ICN. It is absolutely
encouraging to see that there seems to be an infrastructural thinking
in this direction:
<a href=3D"https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/nsdi13/nsdi13-fin=
al182.pdf" target=3D"_blank">https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference=
/nsdi13/nsdi13-final182.pdf</a>

Infact ICN has other proven benefits:

(i)  the publish/subscribe approach reduces bandwidth wastage ( why do
we need to PUSH all the heavy long tailed videos to the cloud - just
publish metadata and based on interest, push the data on demand? This
applies for all the other OSN content sharing..)

(ii) And the other inherent edge caching benefits for localised access
(infact the Google cache initiatives in Africa is encouraging:
<a href=3D"http://www.tnj.com/career/people-move/googles-ory-okolloh-workin=
g-access-and-transparency-sub-saharan-africa" target=3D"_blank">http://www.=
tnj.com/career/people-move/googles-ory-okolloh-working-access-and-transpare=
ncy-sub-saharan-africa</a>)


So my question to all: Is this the right moment to start deploying and
trialling out these new Internet architectures? Yay or Nay?

 If Yay: Are there any planned initiatives? If so, what would be the challe=
nges?

If Nay:  Would just getting an access infrastructure (and all the
other logistics that come with it) to a community would be sufficient?

Arjuna

Came to know about this via Soumya Sen:
http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2014/01/att-sponsored-data/

This is interesting because from our recent public access wifi service
(PAWS) trials here in the UK (www.publicaccesswifi.org) where home
owners share a part of their broadband for free with those who do not
have  - it's been evident from the usage that more than 50% of the
traffic was ads/trackers etc. Via the PAWS project we have been
arguing to provide free Internet access to those who dont have by
extending the stakeholder value chain to include more than the two
traditional parties (consumer and internet service provider) and
encourage new business models that allow governments, charities etc to
subside the cost of access.

We layout the reasons
here:http://www.sigcomm.org/ccr/papers/2013/April/2479957.2479966

So from the usage we have seen, it will be interesting to see if we
can have these reverse sponsored pricing models that will enable
subsidised access reducing the price entry points.

Would this pave the way for lowering the cost of access?

Regards
Arjuna

Hello Steve,
  Thanks a lot for these valuable points. It is indeed clear from your
mail, that there is a regulatory challenge and this requires a
significant push by the A4AI and others. It will be interesting to
have thoughts about this from the CTO (Martin Koyabe - do you have any
views?)

Some questions regarding billing (related to the earlier mail I sent):

(i) Do you have any info on how the price entry points reduced when
the broadband was provided and ran by a social enterprise when
compared to a provider? What was the increase in takeup?

(ii) Did you explore any other pricing schemes that allowed subsidised
access by a third party: local government, NGOs etc?

Regards
Arjuna

Just a point of clarification as I am new to this discussion.  Should I
intuit from your reply that regulation is outside of or perhaps adjunct to
the ambit of the GAIA conversation?

Social enterprise is a murky term and I probably shouldn't have used it.
 In this context, I make no distinction between social enterprise and
regular broadband provider except for the fact that the social enterprise
is deliberately targeting those who don't have or can't afford access.

In terms of pricing, it is important to recognise that size and convenience
of payment may be just as important as the total cost.  BoP pricing which
allows for tiny need/usage-based payments for a service are critical as is
the ability to make the payment in a convenient way.  In sub-Saharan
Africa, the stats on what the poor pay for mobile services as a percentage
of their disposable income is astounding and most of those payments are in
tiny increments.

We deliberately did not.  There are many worthwhile public WiFi schemes
supported by governments, philanthropy, or the private sector but in our
case, we wished to design a technology/service that was affordable to the
poor in its own right.  I can't say we completely got there but I do
believe it is an achievable goal.

Regards... Steve

&gt;&gt;&gt; Its great to know that there is much wider acceptance and expe=
ctations<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; on newer access tech to deliver its promises because of all th=
e known<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; challenges faced by existing access tech.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; So this naturally raises an important question: There has been=

&gt;&gt;&gt; significant amount of work done on new Internet architectures =
for e.g<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) and Information Centric Networ=
king<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; (ICN).There has been some proven evidence how such technologie=

&gt;&gt;&gt; reduce cost of Internet access especially on how DTN could be =
used for<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; time-shifting content during off-peak hours reducing costs<br>

should&#39;nt we<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; start trialling out new Internet architectures that move away =
from the<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; traditional &quot;always-on&quot; model to &quot;almost always=
 off&quot; mode which calls<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; for the need to bring in tech like DTN and ICN. It is absolute=
ly<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; encouraging to see that there seems to be an infrastructural t=
hinking<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; in this direction:<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <a href=3D"https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/nsdi=

&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Infact ICN has other proven benefits:<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; (i) =A0the publish/subscribe approach reduces bandwidth wastag=

&gt;&gt;&gt; we need to PUSH all the heavy long tailed videos to the cloud =

&gt;&gt;&gt; applies for all the other OSN content sharing..)<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; (ii) And the other inherent edge caching benefits for localise=

&gt;&gt;&gt; (infact the Google cache initiatives in Africa is encouraging:=

&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; So my question to all: Is this the right moment to start deplo=

We definitely need to understand all the challenges and hence its
important for us to understand the regulatory challenges and I am glad
you are bringing this topic to our forum.

The reason why I wanted to know more about the pricing was to
understand better on whether making an access technology available (as
you have done through the village telco project) at a reasonable cost
was sufficient enough or a motivator for the community to access and
use the Internet or whether the notion of affordability (even though
the costs were reasonable) were a barrier to entry.


Regards
Arjuna

Hello Martin,
  Thanks for your reply. Its good to know that A4AI is aiming to
address these challenges. We specifically need forward looking
policies as stated in  the  A4AI affordability report ( published last
month) : http://a4ai.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Affordability-Report-20=
13-FINAL.pdf

Regards
Arjuna

Dear All,
  I had some offline conversations with Lars Eggert on what are the
possibilities of organising a IRTF sponsored workshop as a possible
venue to gather the group in one place to discuss the
experiences/issues, to gather interest on possible activities and come
out with a plan to take GAIA forward as an official chartered IRTF
group.

We would like to know whether there will be general interest for such
a workshop?

If so where could this be? One option could be we could try and
arrange something during the IETF here in London this March if
possible or we could arrange this as a proper IRTF workshop in a place
like South Africa if that will ensure maximum participation.

Please let us know.

Thanks
Arjuna

All,
  Just heard  from Lars, that he can arrange a meeting slot during the
London week as a "RG-to-be". Meeting slots are 2.5h max.

Alternatively if we want a (longer) meeting on the Saturday or Sunday
before the IETF week starts, he can also arrange that.

But we have to make a decision by this week. I will wait for some more
feedback before setting up a doodle poll.

Regards
Arjuna

on billing:

WIFI hotspots that charge ended up hijacking DNS lookups to force users to
home pages for collecting money - maybe we should invent a billing protocol
that standardizes the way in which one obtains access to facilities that
need/want to charge for service?

&gt; Hello Steve,<br>
&gt; =C2=A0 Thanks a lot for these valuable points. It is indeed clear from=
 your<br>
&gt; mail, that there is a regulatory challenge and this requires a<br>
&gt; significant push by the A4AI and others. It will be interesting to<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; Some questions regarding billing (related to the earlier mail I sent):=
<br>
&gt;<br>

&gt; the broadband was provided and ran by a social enterprise when<br>

 to see<br>
&gt;&gt; national broadband plans acknowledging the role of unlicensed spec=

&gt;&gt; that might lead to a change in point 2.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; 2/ =C2=A0ISM band regulation is far from normalised across countri=
es. =C2=A0We<br>
&gt;&gt; assume<br>
&gt;&gt; that WiFi is legal everywhere but the truth is the regulation of W=

&gt;&gt; (point-to-point in particular) is pretty inconsistent. =C2=A0In Zi=
mbabwe, use<br>
&gt;&gt; of<br>
&gt;&gt; ISM bands for point-to-point connections is not illegal but a lice=

&gt;&gt; There<br>

&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; 3/ =C2=A0Last and most important, mechanisms for entrepreneurs are=
 key. =C2=A0Simple<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; start trialling out new Internet architectures that move a=
way from the<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; traditional &quot;always-on&quot; model to &quot;almost al=
ways off&quot; mode which calls<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for the need to bring in tech like DTN and ICN. It is abso=

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; encouraging to see that there seems to be an infrastructur=

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Infact ICN has other proven benefits:<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (i) =C2=A0the publish/subscribe approach reduces bandwidth=

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; applies for all the other OSN content sharing..)<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (ii) And the other inherent edge caching benefits for loca=

Dear All,

I have had some offline email suggestions that it will be better to
have 2.5 hour meeting at the IETF in March to get the ball running as
we can participation from the IETFers too.

The IETF meeting is from March 2-7, 2014 and I have now setup a doodle
poll to know what would be the ideal date and time. The poll will
close by tomorrow the 10th January at 10:00 am UK time - so that I can
pass on the info to Lars Eggert for him to arrange the logistics.

Please vote here:
http://doodle.com/rey7xuefv2p7gktd

Warren Kumari (Google) will be co-chairing the meeting along with me.

Also in the comments section, please let us know whether you intend to
talk or just participate.

Thanks
Arjuna

Hi all,

My name is Edjair Mota, I am a professor at the Institute of Computing,
University of Amazonas, in Brazil. Thanks a lot for the invitation of
taking part in this forum.

Together with Eduardo Cerqueira, University of Par=E1, also taking part in
this forum, we wrote an internal project which main goal is to learn how
DTN technology can be deployed to the riparian communities in the Amazon
region, providing support to the design and implementation of a robust, yet
reliable communication infrastructure, with access to the Internet. Long
distances among the Amazon cities connected by large rivers through a dense
forest of towering trees justify such a project. The social exclusion of
its population is estimated around 70%. The idea is to investigate advanced
technologies that can support the development of a communication system
based on DTN technology, for a hostile environment, dense forest, high
humidity levels.

We selected six riparian communities located in the Sustainable Reserve of
Tup=E9, 30 Km away from Manaus since they represent a typical Amazon scenar=
io
with no efficient communication system, and are not so far from our
university (consider traveling some days by boat to achieve other cities).
The boats crossing the river around the reserve will carry messages
exchanged among the schools and communities. In order to improve the
reachability of the content dissemination inside the reserve, we will model
the behavior of the local people to build a realistic mobility model that
feed simulation models to evaluate alternatives. Inside the communities,
Android-based mobile configured to operate in DTN mode will disseminate the
messages.

Applications and services definition thought for this project with high
priority are health, transport, education, and environment. A prime focus
will be the delivery of videolectures, considered as a powerful tool for
people with reading difficulties.

I would like to receive suggestions or hear other experiences that can
improve such a challenging task.

Regards,

Edjair Mota

Dear Vint,
  Thanks for your reply.  I am not an AAA person but some thoughts.
Steve and others could provide some input.

Will be good to see how we could tie up payments to M-PESA?:
http://www.capitalfm.co.ke/business/2013/12/use-m-pesa-to-make-online-payme=
nts.
>From Steve's thoughts it looks like usage based payments/micropayments
are the key (as a digression this ties in with some nice adaptive QoS
tricks we could explore)

Jon Crowcroft had some very nice ideas about using bitcoin.

Many of these WiFi hotspots use captive portals that kind of redirect
them to do the payment - probably the AAA being governed by RADIUS
etc..One issue as you mention is that these portals could be easy
circumvented.

One possible option (which is not the great option from experience) is
using VPN to a central endpoint governed by the operator or some other
trusted third party as we do via the PAWS project. But from our PAWS
deployment, VPN has been a nightmare in terms of deployment:

1/ Users find it hard to configure VPNs and logging in on their
devices - so we need better ways of doing that..one idea here - how
about a user's preconfigured VPN fires in automatically whenever there
is an open SSID aka open public network without the user manually
setting it up? Is there any current provision in Android to do that?

2/We have had serious difficulties running PPTP over Android

3/Many home access points dont allow VPN passthrough by default! This
needs manual intervention.

Not sure how SDN could be used as a solution to circumvent some of the
solutions - but it could offer greater control for governing access.


Regards
Arjuna

Hello Edjair,

Thanks for your reply..

So this is a nice example where the current Internet is far stretched
and where traditional access tech fails.

So are there any LOS challenges for doing long range WiFi? Do you have
any info on the spectrum issues in these areas? Whether something like
White Space could be an ideal solution?

All,

This discussion actually leads me to Scott Burleigh's Ring road idea :
http://www.ipnsig.org/reports/RingRoad.pdf

Would be interested to know what would be the challenges in deploying
such a network for emergency/vital communications: funded by
governments/NGOs who link up to the network..

Would be good to get some thoughts from folks from Google.org about
the project loon too..

Regards
Arjuna

Pretty much. The sustainable reserve we selected for the project is
around 38 km away, and the idea is to extend the results to other
communities along the rivers, and our vision is that maintenance for
such an infrastructure would be prohibitive.

The biggest Brazilian TV operator cover 98.6% of the Amazon Region,
and I think it could be a suitable though challenging solution.

One of the reasons why digital exclusion is not just common to
developing regions but also in the developed world.

All,
   We have requested a room for the meeting and are currently waiting
for the IETF to confirm the date/time (which is likely to be either
March 6th pm or March 7th am).

Warren and I are meeting early next week to plan the agenda.

I see that some of you are interested to give a talk. I also received
some offline emails from folks wishing to attend and talk.

For those who wish to give a talk - Could you please send us an email
us details on the topic by Monday next week. Based on the number of
talks we can then plan the durations of the talk/agenda etc?

For the new members who joined in - please see this message for
details : http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/gaia/current/msg00041.html

If you are intending to attend, please send me an email so that we
have the numbers. Thanks.

Arjuna
