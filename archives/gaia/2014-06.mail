All,
  Just to let you all know Lakshmi and I are working out the GAIA
workshop arrangements for Dec 4th with the DEV chairs. It will be in
the Hilton Hotel (will let you know the address) in San Francisco.
Hopefully within the next few weeks we will provide you with the
details.

The next announcement is about building the European community who are
working on networking technologies directly/indirectly for development
-

I had a chat with Marco Zennaro from ICTP
(http://wireless.ictp.it/about.html). We think it will be good to host
an workshop focussed on the European community. The idea of the
workshop would be bring together the different research groups in
Europe who are currently working in the area of Internet access
provisioning as well as in areas directly related, to create
networking opportunities between them, and to also explore/create EU
H2020 funding opportunities together. But the important part of the
agenda would be drive/create a 3-5 year research agenda with
measurable outcomes. We are planning to invite folks from the European
Commission too.

The workshop will be held in Cambridge at the Computer Lab. So the
possible dates for the workshop would be sometime in October. There is
no registration fees - only your own travel costs. We are trying to
get some funding to host this workshop to cover food.

I know we have the CnBub workshop - so how about October third week?
We may have a two or three day event based on participation/interests.
Two is highly likely and seems optimal.

We are hoping to get maximum participation from the european GAIA
members as well as non-GAIA (this event will be a platform to get them
onboard too!).

Let me know the thoughts.

Arjuna

Hi Arjuna,

Great to see the efforts at the European level, in addition to the GAIA
preparations.

I could do a workshop during October in Cambridge. The sooner we fix the
date, the better.

Best,

Thanks for the positive response for the workshop in October.

Leandro who coordinates the EU Confine project suggested to me that
the Confine meeting will be held in Rome on October 28, 29 and 30.
Most of the community wireless network operators will be attending. So
he suggested we could have our meeting in Rome if we wanted to.

Ofcourse, this depends on where the majority would like to have the
meeting depending on your travel budget/plans.

But will be good to know your opinion.

If you prefer Cambridge, then I can go ahead and suggest dates (Oct
20, 21) and book the logistics. If its Rome, then it will be October
26-27 and we have to go via University of Roma.

Both locations sound good for a number of reasons, Arjuna.

Perhaps run some budgetary planning numbers with the respective local 
hosts in each location and what might be contributed in-kind (meeting 
space, connectivity, etc.) to get a better sense of the costs in each 
location.

Thanks Steve.

If its Cambridge, we can book a meeting room free of charge and we
have free WiFi connectivity (including eduroam). The only cost would
be food and any other extras. Mat Ford suggested we could try ISOC for
funding to host. Marco also has a few funding options which he can
pursue. I am not sure about UoRoma - i think its pretty much the same
as Cambridge.

Regards
Arjuna

All,
  I heard from a number of people including Marco Zennaro that we will
stick to the Cambridge plan. The dates Oct 20 and 21 seem to be good
to many. I will book a room here in the lab for those dates. I will
organise the rest with Marco and then send you the agenda. Hoping to
see many of you here. To get an idea of headcount - can you fill in
the doodle poll please:

http://doodle.com/kq4nxewwsytwvva6

Please do it asap - so that we have the headcount to sort the
logistics and to have an idea of the costs involved to request for
funding. Thanks.

Regards
Arjuna

  I heard from a number of people including Marco Zennaro that we will
stick to the Cambridge plan. The dates Oct 20 and 21 seem to be good
to many. I will book a room here in the lab for those dates. I will
organise the rest with Marco and then send you the agenda. Hoping to

All,
  Thanks for the great response for the October workshop in Cambridge.
We seem to have around 25 members who have confirmed
(http://doodle.com/kq4nxewwsytwvva6e8mepiau/admin#table) and another 4
members who have confirmed to me by email. 30 is a good number.

If anyone is still keen to join and have not voited, please fill in
the doodle poll soon - I will close the poll end of this week and
finalise the numbers. Thanks.

Regards
Arjuna

We have FON here in Europe --

We are Cambridge took that further with PAWS
(http://publicaccesswifi.org/) - offering free Internet access using
the same approach (with all the tech and economics thrown in  to make

Hi all,

After some weeks, we have been able to build an Internet Draft about =
Community Networks. At this stage we would like to hear the feedback =
from people in the list.

Hi,

We have a first question. We had some doubts about this: should we =
include in the draft Networks in which Wi-Fi is shared by individuals, =
but they are in fact managed by a company (e.g. FON)?

As you may see, in the current version they are not included, but we =
have some doubts...

We have a first question. We had some doubts about this: should we =

but they are in fact managed by a company (e.g. FON)?

As you may see, in the current version they are not included, but we =

Well, for me is simple:=20

1) Community networks is mainly about expanding the network =
infrastructure (mostly wireless, reaching places and people not covered =
by other models)  !=3D  Internet access service + business model built =
on federated wifi access points on existing networks (Fon or Eduroam).=20=


2) There are also municipal networks that share more traits with =
community networks (different org, level of participation, etc), but =
clearly:
 community !=3D company (many implications).=20

Related but not equal ... better use different terms and describe =
separately to avoid increasing confusion and diluting the term =
=93community network=94 too much.

Hello,

we have named such architectures as User-centric Networks.- 
http://uloop.eu (FON was also involved in this project :)). The 
diference between such cases seems to relate with the way that the 
network grows (network dynamics):
- cooperative behavior (some form of incentive, even if it is monetization)
- based on trust (integrates non-repudiation so that users that owned 
shared devices cannot be accused of actions on behalf of others)
- self-organizing - networking nodes are often mobile, and placed in the 
customer premises.


So: if an operator manages such a networking architecture, or at least 
some aspects, it is still a community network.

Where would we draw the borderline, if architecturally though they're all more or less the same?

Hi all,

I have a slightly different perspective.  While I fully support community
wireless networks and there are truly awe-inspiring examples of this such
as Guifi.net, I would not use this as an organising principle.   For me the
key organising principle is the decentralisation of communication
infrastructure.[1]

By limiting ourselves to WiFi generation technologies, we exclude other
inspiring examples such as the Rhizomatica GSM network in Oaxaca.[2]   We
also rule out community fibre initiatives which is where Guifi.net have
been moving to as well as many other communities[3]

I believe it is also a mistake to limit this to non-profit initiatives.  In
places where there are strong existing social ties, community networks are
a natural extension existing community structures.  In my experience in
sub-Saharan Africa, entrepreneurship often turns out to be more successful
as a model that taps into the aspirations of local businesses.

What defines them all is that they are local to the people they are trying
to serve and increase their voice and bargaining power with larger
networks.  There are many basic principles then that can be derived from
this stance, including rights of way, access to spectrum, tax incentives
for locally-owned networks, strategies for municipalities, etc.

Cheers... Steve

orate entity over a social community (e.g., a cooperative formed by these u=
sers) to a regional authority (e.g., a municipality trying to foster local =
Internet uptake or dedicated programmes like digital education). Where woul=
d we draw the borderline, if architecturally though they&#39;re all more or=
 less the same?<br>

Hi,<br>
<br>
We have a first question. We had some doubts about this: should we include =
in the draft Networks in which Wi-Fi is shared by individuals, but they are=
 in fact managed by a company (e.g. FON)?<br>
<br>
&gt; &gt; =A0 =A0There exist other networks, also based on sharing wireless=

As you may see, in the current version they are not included, but we have s=

Hi Jose,

IMHO it's really sad to see that there isn't any Community Network
amongst the organisations of the authors. Sad because: 1) I'm pretty
sure that this lack implies missing very important details (for
instance, include or not FON model as a CN is not questionable by any
community member - obviously the answer is _NO_), 2) it's a lack of
respect towards all CNs member and the amazing work they have done,
mostly as volunteers, a lack of respect because it looks a clear attempt
of appropriation of this work.

Although I haven't had the time to go through all the draft because I
have discovered the draft just few minutes ago (from your previous post)
I have read enough to notice serious mistakes, like the mix of Community
Networks and Community Wireless Networks terms. Thus I kindly suggest
you to invite well-known community members to review the document before
submitting it.

Kind regards

Hi, Roger.

This is just the version 00 of a draft. And this is the IRTF, so the =
opinion of everybody counts. From the very beginning, we have accepted =
in the draft everyone who wanted to participate. And people =
participating do know about this. In fact, everyone knows more than me.

We knew that this question was tricky and difficult. In fact, there was =
not even consensus about it between the authors of the draft. So we =
decided to send this version to the list and hear everyone.

If you think the answer is NO, and people agree on separating different =
kinds of networks on different documents, we will do it for sure.


Jose

Hi Dirk,

Clearly this is a difficult question. We wanted to write a document =
about Community Networks. But clearly the borderlines and the =
classification are tricky.

We have tried to find some characteristics and components in order to =
build a "taxonomy". It seems that we are still far from a good solution. =
That is why we have submitted this draft. We need the (constructive if =
possible) opinion and experience of people in the list.

Perhaps we could try to find some "orthogonal" characteristics in order =
to build a good classification. It can be based on:

- Technology
- Economy
- People involvement
- Resource sharing


For example, the contribution of Steve reporting this: "By limiting =
ourselves to WiFi generation technologies, we exclude other inspiring =
examples such as the Rhizomatica GSM network in Oaxaca.[2]   We also =
rule out community fibre initiatives which is where Guifi.net have been =
moving to as well as many other communities[3]" is very good, since we =
get an example of non-Wi-Fi (and not even wireless) CN.


Jose

Jose and list members,

I must apologise for my previous mail. Its tone was definitely not
appropriate, so there now need to step into its contents. Please, accept
my apologises.

PS I'll send my comments to the draft asap.

I'm wondering whether some of the shortcomings in the paper being =
pointed to might not be overcome through a reflection on some of the =
quite extensive history of Community Networking (going back at least 20 =
years) where many of these issues have been extensively discussed =
including for example the (key word searchable) 14 year archives of the =
Community Informatics research network =
<http://vancouvercommunity.net/lists/arc/ciresearchers>  or the peer =
reviewed Journal of Community Informatics <http://ci-journal.net/>  =
(also key word searchable).  As well a usable bibliography could be put =
together fairly easily from either of those sources or I would guess =
from a query sent to the CIresearchers elist.

Hi, Roger.

=20

This is just the version 00 of a draft. And this is the IRTF, so the =
opinion of everybody counts. From the very beginning, we have accepted =
in the draft everyone who wanted to participate. And people =
participating do know about this. In fact, everyone knows more than me.

=20

We knew that this question was tricky and difficult. In fact, there was =
not even consensus about it between the authors of the draft. So we =
decided to send this version to the list and hear everyone.

=20

If you think the answer is NO, and people agree on separating different =
kinds of networks on different documents, we will do it for sure.

Hello Roger, All
  As Jose mentioned - this is an IRTF draft and we will be having
multiple revisions based on comments/feedback from anyone and this
will be published as an RFC only once everyone are happy with the
contents (and if GAIA becomes chartered) :)..so keep the
discussions/arguments coming.

Anyone can write a draft on anything thats relevant to GAIA -so if
anyone is keen to contribute, please do so. I think this is the sort
of discussions and engagement we need from the members - so this looks
like a great start :).

Steve and Dirk (and others) have mentioned some very important points
- i think we should try and address them too in the next set of
revisions.

Regards
Arjuna

Looking through Steve and Dirk's comments again - I think its
important for us to address all possible initiatives including profit
and wired- but we need to identify a better way of classifying them.

If anyone has suggestions - please do so.

some personal views:

(1) i don't believe that the mere involvement of a for-profit element in 
running a network makes it not a "community network."  lots of gray 
areas.  any internet transit will ultimately pass through (and pay) a 
commercial provider.  any paid staff are working for personal benefit to 
a certain degree.

(2) i don't believe that nominal motivations are a helpful distinction. 
  different people have different motivations to do things and the 
motivations are usually poorly defined.  what is access?  is building a 
rural fiber network (where users have copper or wireless) "increasing 
access"?  when a city gives an operator the right to build a for-profit 
network but saddles it with universal service obligations, does that 
make it a community network because it's increasing access to a very 
high fraction of the population?

(2) i don't believe that the sub-L3 network technology is a useful 
categorization.  there are rural community fiber networks (e.g., rural 
UK and DE) as well as rural wireless networks.  (side comment: imo, the 
technical discussion in this draft could mostly be replaced with more 
pointers to WNDW...)

(3) here's a duck-type idea for you folks to criticize: a community 
network is one in which

- community members are directly contributing active network 
infrastructure (not just passive infrastructure), and
- community members have a obvious and direct form of organizational 
control over the overall operation of the network in their community 
(not just their own participation in the network)

ex: US cable company.  in the US, the cable company is likely providing 
a network that can serve much of your community (high fraction of homes 
passed), and you contribute the coax in your home as part of that 
network if you subscribe.  but coax is passive infrastructure, you 
aren't doing anything other than paying, and you are just a customer.

ex: Guifi vs. Fon.  in both cases, users buy a CPE (active 
infrastructure) to join the network.  but Fon, as a conventional 
corporate entity, does not give community members any control other than 
the ability to participate (according to their TOS) or not.  that is, 
the network is controlled by an entity that is not accountable to 
individuals except as customers.

ex: that rural german fiber network, BBNG 
(http://www.thelocal.de/20140601/german-villagers-build-own-broadband-network). 
  it's run by paid staff working for an entity that is funded by 
investors (who are not all local).  BUT its service footprint is such 
that the entity will fail (with complete certainty) if the served 
community stops using it, so it has total commercial accountability to 
the community.

no doubt there are serious problems with this definition, too, but it 
seems to work ok in my head right at the moment...

Hi,

Some comments on general aspects:

*Terms*
"Community Networks", specially thanks to CONFINE's contributions [1],
seems to have a rather board consensus. Many of the participants also
feel comfortable with "Free Networks" (term use long before CONFINE) but
the term "free" has been proved to be problematic (free beer vs. free
speech + others). "Network Commons" is a term that sometimes has been
proposed, because what we do is to share our network resources in
commons, but it has been ruled out because of the it is confusing (a
network of commons?). In any case, the terms such "Wireless" must be
avoided because it adds unjustified limitations.

*Technology*
(strictly related with the previous point) We must keep the concept of
"Community Networks" agnostic from the technical point of view.
Technology in this case must be taken as implementation, thus, must not
be part of the specification. Moreover, better if CNs are implemented in
a way that several technologies (Ad-Hoc WiFi, Infrastructure WiFi,
Optical Fibre, IPv4, IPv6, RFC1918, OLSR, BMX6, etc.) coexist. From this
point of view, CNs must be seen as part of the Internet, and in the
Internet the technical specifications are kept as small as possible
(roughly interoperability -BGP- and uniqueness -ASes and IPs).

*Infrastructure vs. contents*
CNs is a specification about how the network infrastructure is build,
maintained and operated. Contents are out of the scope of this
specification (thus, contents must freely circulated in the
infrastructure -as long as they are legitimate, in the sense that they
do not harm the infrastructure functionality).

*Internet connectivity*
At least to guifi.net understanding (and other CNs we know) Inet access
is considered a service, thus, the terms on how it is made available (if
at all) are up to the provider as in any other content (e-mails
accounts, VoIP, etc.)

*Profit*
Business in CNs are not only possible because there are no restrictions
on the contents but they are desirable because they are essential to
make a project sustainable (an ecosystem). Very important (the trait, I
dare say) the working hypothesis of CNs is that the profit can only be
made by services and not by the infrastructure itself because the
infrastructure is neutral, free, and open (traditional ISPs base their
business on the control of the infrastructure)

*proposals of definition*
The following proposals can be used as a starting point.

Free Network Foundation [2] propose the following [3]:
"
Free network definition
  A free network equitably grants the following freedoms to all:
  Freedom 0 - Freedom to communicate for any purpose, without
discrimination, interference, or interception.
  Freedom 1 - The freedom to grow, improve, communicate across, and
connect to the whole network.
  Freedom 2- The freedom to study, use, remix, and share any network
communication mechanisms, in their most reusable forms.
"

In guifi.net we have a license, the XOLN Compact [4] (English
translation is a WiP) that everybody must subscribe to join the network.
The first article says:
""
I) Summary and General principles
  The fundamental principles of the XOLN Compact are:
    -. You have the freedom to use the network for any purpose as long
as you don't harm the operation of the network itself , the rights of
other users, or the principles of neutrality that allow contents and
services to flow without deliberate interference.
    -. You have the right to understand the network, to know its
components, and to spread knowledge of its mechanisms and principles.
    -. You have the right to offer services and content to the network
on your own terms.
    -. You have the right to join the network, and the responsibility to
extend this set of rights to anyone according to these same terms.

[2] http://thefnf.org
[3] https://commons.thefnf.org/index.php/Free_network_definition
[4] http://guifi.net/ca/CXOLN

*License*
Although I do not feel in the position (yet?) of stating whether a CNs
must necessarily have a license I can say that at least in guifi.net
everybody agrees in identifying it as one of our success keys.

*Organisations*
All kind of organisations and entities must coexist (associations,
individuals, public administrations, enterprises, etc.). In guifi.net
having a non-profit non-partisan Foundation that has the mandate to take
care of the license and to promote the CN is a very positive experience.

*Ownership*
everybody keeps the ownership of what has contributed.

Regards.

Hi Everyone,

Just to briefly introduce myself, my most relevant experience to this group
is that I helped build a large portion of a long-range 5Ghz WiFi backbone
in Haiti with Inveneo; before that I was an active participant in the IETF
in the RAI space for many years; currently I work as a field logistician
for an international non-profit in South Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo.

To me the key difference between FON and what the authors call a community
network is the ability to actively enlarge the network. FON capitalizes on
an existing network. It does not extend that network, it merely allows
reciprocal access to that network by individual nodes. While this is
already a good and useful thing, I think what many of the authors of the
draft want to define is a user-extensible network. Below is my strawman
definition.

User-extensible network: A network in which any participant in the system
may add link segments to the network in such a way that the new network
segments can support multiple nodes and adopt the same overall
characteristics as those of the joined network, including the capacity to
further extend the network. Once these link segments are joined to the
network, there is no longer a meaningful distinction between the previous
extent of the network and the new extent of the network.

Note that this covers a large part of the Free Network Foundation's Freedom
1 as posted by Roger, but not all of it.

Practically I think this means that new segments of a user-extensible
network do not involve IP address translation at the boundary of the
network. This is important architecturally, so if someone has a good
counter-example, please respond.

For me it does not matter if the network is wired or wireless, licensed or
unlicensed spectrum, or what technologies are used. It does not matter if
the network has a fee structure or who administers the network. I agree
with Steve that commercial extensible networks should be included. In Haiti
and the parts of sub-Saharan Africa where I have lived (Benin, South Sudan,
DRC) a commercial entity has a better chance of getting off the ground.

Thanks,
-rohan

Hi,

just a quick clarification: this isn't an IRTF draft *yet*, because GAIA =
isn't an official research group yet. (Aside: I am thinking that maybe =
we can have a chartering discussion during the planned Cambridge =
meeting.)

When GAIA is chartered, it can adopt drafts as working items. Those =
would then be named draft-irtf-gaia-something-or-other as opposed to =
draft-somethingelse-gaia-something-or-other.

The former kind of draft name signifies research group adoption, the =
latter signifies that a draft by individuals is *targeted* at adoption =
by the research group indicated in the draft name.

(I realize this distinction based on the filename isn't the most =
obvious; it's an historic artifact of the IETF and IRTF.)

In terms of how you should all collaborate on this draft right now, all =
of this has no impact - keep discussing! I just wanted to clarify some =
wrinkles of the IRTF process.

Rohan, all,

=20

I cannot help but notice that the discussion on definitions already
reveals core principles that this community sees at the heart of their
work - so good to see this discussion but necessary to capture these
various viewpoints more distinctively as 'principles'.

=20

As for your definition, Rohan:

User-extensible network: A network in which any participant in the
system may add link segments to the network in such a way that the new
network segments can support multiple nodes and adopt the same overall
characteristics as those of the joined network, including the capacity
to further extend the network. Once these link segments are joined to
the network, there is no longer a meaningful distinction between the
previous extent of the network and the new extent of the network.=20

=20

I wonder how my 'passive infrastructure' based DSL or cable network fits
in here. Let's start from scratch: a housing community (e.g., in the
middle of London) will add link segments to the network, often through a
commercial offering. If it is a new development, cables need to be
pulled and laid in the new development, again often through an (open?)
access provider. If it is an existing development, the existing cable
infrastructure is likely re-used, although at the network level you are
repeating the process of 'add link segments' by re-activating, e.g., the
DSL line to the apartment(s). So a standard BT OpenReach+Retail ISP way
of doing things seem to be fitting under that definition, doesn't it?=20

=20

Nevertheless, as pointed out in the beginning, your very definition
entails a set of principles for 'building networks' that is worthwhile
capturing as such.

=20

Best,

=20

Dirk

Subject: [gaia] Difference between FON and a "manyfolks Community
Network"

Hi Everyone,


Just to briefly introduce myself, my most relevant experience to this
group is that I helped build a large portion of a long-range 5Ghz WiFi
backbone in Haiti with Inveneo; before that I was an active participant
in the IETF in the RAI space for many years; currently I work as a field
logistician for an international non-profit in South Kivu, Democratic
Republic of Congo.

=20

To me the key difference between FON and what the authors call a
community network is the ability to actively enlarge the network. FON
capitalizes on an existing network. It does not extend that network, it
merely allows reciprocal access to that network by individual nodes.
While this is already a good and useful thing, I think what many of the
authors of the draft want to define is a user-extensible network. Below
is my strawman definition.

=20

User-extensible network: A network in which any participant in the
system may add link segments to the network in such a way that the new
network segments can support multiple nodes and adopt the same overall
characteristics as those of the joined network, including the capacity
to further extend the network. Once these link segments are joined to
the network, there is no longer a meaningful distinction between the
previous extent of the network and the new extent of the network.=20

=20

Note that this covers a large part of the Free Network Foundation's
Freedom 1 as posted by Roger, but not all of it.

=20

Practically I think this means that new segments of a user-extensible
network do not involve IP address translation at the boundary of the
network. This is important architecturally, so if someone has a good
counter-example, please respond.

=20

For me it does not matter if the network is wired or wireless, licensed
or unlicensed spectrum, or what technologies are used. It does not
matter if the network has a fee structure or who administers the
network. I agree with Steve that commercial extensible networks should
be included. In Haiti and the parts of sub-Saharan Africa where I have
lived (Benin, South Sudan, DRC) a commercial entity has a better chance
of getting off the ground.=20

=20

Thanks,

-rohan

If you are looking into a notion of community networks, the networks 
where resources are shared based on self-organizing, user-centric 
extensions of the usual customer premises cannot be left aside. Just as 
example, in Portugal, there is an operator, ZON, now known as NOS, that 
places APs in any household following the FON model. This means that 
there are over 700k hotspots open, where resources are shared. These are 
OpenWRT APs, and at home I can do whatever I want with my AP. These are 
hotspots that are extensible, based on the user's willingness to share 
access with thirds. Not just 1 hop away.

Again, we have named these architectures user-centric networks, and we 
have analyzed in a prior EU project both the community aspect with and 
without operator involvement. MAin use-cases involving the operator 
related with offloading and expanded coverage. Main use-case WITHOUT the 
operator involvement related with cooperative services (community services).

The definition of community in the case of the specific model mentioned, 
UCN was:
" A set of UCN nodes whose owners share common interests (e.g. sharing 
connectivity; resources; peripherals) regardless of their physical 
location. The node location exhibits a space and time correlation which 
is the basis to establish a robust connectivity model over time"

*Interest*: a parameter capable of providing a measure (cost) of the 
attractiveness of a node towards a specific location, in a specific 
instant in time.

The owner: an entity (e.g. end-user; operator; virtual operator; 
municipality) that is to be made responsible for any actions concerning 
his/her device.

The user: a legal entity or an individual using or requesting a publicly 
available electronic communications' service for private or business 
purposes, without necessarily having subscribed to such service.

Resources: A physical or virtual element of a global system. For 
instance, bandwdith; energy; data; devices.


And the Virtual Operator: entity that acts in some aspects as a UCN 
community coordinator. It may provide services such as initial 
authentication or registering, and eventually, trust relationship 
storage. A VO is not an ISP given that it does not provide Internet 
access (e.g. infrastructure; naming). A VO is neither an ASP since it 
does not provide user services.

>>>>     other times, they are built as a complement and an alternative to

>>>>
>>>>     These community wireless networks have self sustainable business
>>>>     models that provide more localised communication services as well as

Hi all,

I like the idea of user-extensibility as a principle.  I was coming at this
from the point of view of decentralised, locally owned and operated
networks.  I think it roughly amounts to the same thing.

Taking it down yet another level, the key motivation for me in encouraging
the decentralisation of network development is increasing "agency", in the
sense intended by Amartya Sen[1], for individuals and communities.  What
that translates to from a broadband perspective is the ability of
individuals and communities to act to change their own connectivity status.
 It also translates to the ability to consolidate demand to increase buying
power whether through collective, community initiatives or through local
entrepreneurship.

I would like to emphasise that there is arguably more policy and regulatory
work that needs to be done to enable this than technological innovation.
 This can be illustrated by the simple fact that point-to-point WiFi, which
most of us take for granted, is not free (as in beer) in most sub-Saharan
African countries.  License fees are often many times the cost of the
equipment.  Other things like network license exemption for non-profits or
cooperatives are other frontiers worth pursuing.

Looking at this from another angle, there is also the notion of increasing
overall network resilience (I actually mean antifragility here but that is
perhaps another discussion) through diversity of access and through
decentralisation.  While this is arguably a technological issue, it is also
fairly politically charged.  I raise this in the spirit of getting all my
"issues" out on the table.  :)

Cheers... Steve

 the IETF in the RAI space for many years; currently I work as a field logi=
stician for an international non-profit in South Kivu, Democratic Republic =
of Congo.<u></u><u></u></p>
</div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal"><u></u>&nbsp;<u></u></p></div><div><p cla=
ss=3D"MsoNormal">To me the key difference between FON and what the authors =
call a community network is the ability to actively enlarge the network. FO=
N capitalizes on an existing network. It does not extend that network, it m=
erely allows reciprocal access to that network by individual nodes. While t=
his is already a good and useful thing, I think what many of the authors of=
 the draft want to define is a user-extensible network. Below is my strawma=
n definition.<u></u><u></u></p>
</div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal"><u></u>&nbsp;<u></u></p></div><div><p cla=
ss=3D"MsoNormal">User-extensible network: A network in which any participan=
t in the system may add link segments to the network in such a way that the=
 new network segments can support multiple nodes and adopt the same overall=
 characteristics as those of the joined network, including the capacity to =
further extend the network. Once these link segments are joined to the netw=
ork, there is no longer a meaningful distinction between the previous exten=
t of the network and the new extent of the network.&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p>

ss=3D"MsoNormal">Practically I think this means that new segments of a user=
-extensible network do not involve IP address translation at the boundary o=
f the network. This is important architecturally, so if someone has a good =
counter-example, please respond.<u></u><u></u></p>
</div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal"><u></u>&nbsp;<u></u></p></div><div><p cla=

s not matter if the network has a fee structure or who administers the netw=
ork. I agree with Steve that commercial extensible networks should be inclu=
ded. In Haiti and the parts of sub-Saharan Africa where I have lived (Benin=
, South Sudan, DRC) a commercial entity has a better chance of getting off =
the ground.&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p>

Hello Rohan, All,

  So talking about user-extensibility as a criteria for defining
community networks may have an issue -

I agree that FON may not be classified as a community network since
its an extension of an user's already paid service and its presence is
in areas where network operators have existing network coverage.

However, a system like PAWS (http://publicaccesswifi.org/) for e.g.
uses the same FON model - but it targets people with socio-economical
challenges to get broadband access and its run purely by the
involvement of the community, a local stakeholder who has a benefit of
getting people connected and they work with a network operator to do
so. So a PAWS type system has a social objective of helping connect
your neighbour/community who may not be able to afford to connect
otherwise. But it involves the three stakeholders: users, network
operators and the so called VNO.

Ofcourse the PAWS type model is extensible as well - I think Freifunk
does that. Other community wireless mesh networks does similar for
e.g. talking to the Sarantaporo.gr folks their entire network
connecting 18 villages is backhauled over two ADSL lines volunteered
by home broadband owners (surprisingly with the blessings of their
network operator - not sure about their business objectives)..


Regards
Arjuna

...to me as a person entering the 'coverage' of a FON hotspot, I gain
connectivity where I don't have any otherwise. If I have FON enabled
myself, I don't even pay for access. It's an odd of separation. I think
we ought to tease out the technological approaches being used throughout
the various examples and separately tease out the operational/economic
models placed on top of it. Only then (if at all) would I start with
'name calling' (e.g., user extensible, community network, ...).

All,
  The poll has now been closed. I have attached the confirmed
participants list for the poll - great to see a mix of disciplines and
stakeholders involved. We will make arrangements for 40 people here
(37 have confirmed + 1 by email + 2 for EC officers).

I have booked the room in the lab.

We will see if we can sort out some funding for food.

Will get back on more details.

Thanks for the great support.

Regards

Jose, All,

So from the different replies and also from what I envision - this is
what I get -

1/Community networks are formed because the traditional network
operator has failed to provide coverage through equipment deployment
and/or failed to provide affordable services to a community.

2/The community now takes matter into its own hands - joins together
to form an entity "or" there could be another entity that is keen to
support the community stepping into help and support - so this is not
the traditional NO - but someone like the local govt, charitable
organisation or a local business. The latter entity may have some
benefit: social, economical, environmental et al.

So my question here is would the latter be classified as a community
network or something else.

>From what I see from Paul's reply, the latter will not be classified
as a community network since the local community do have any form of
control there.

BUT - I also see from Steve and Rohan's reply and Paul also agrees
that we should not discount "for-profit" initiatives which means the
local community may not have any control in such an entity.

So from all this the way I decipher the message that we need to be
more inclusive:

Community networks are networks that are

1/decentralised and formed because the traditional network operator
has failed to provide coverage through equipment deployment and/or
failed to provide affordable services to a community.
2/locally owned within the community with community members directly
contributing to active network infrastructure to extend then network
and having some form of organisational control
3/Or owned by an entity that is not the traditional network operator
that has specific interests in supporting the community either for
profit or non-profit
4/Can be both wired and/or wireless.

Does that sound right? I am not sure what Leandro thinks of point (3) :).

Hello Paul - this is an excellent example. So its not only about the
community having organisational control but it could also be
commercial entity that "solely" depends on the community for
sustainability and hence has commercial accountability. Excellent one.


> ex: that rural german fiber network, BBNG
> (http://www.thelocal.de/20140601/german-villagers-build-own-broadband-network).
> it's run by paid staff working for an entity that is funded by investors
> (who are not all local).  BUT its service footprint is such that the entity
> will fail (with complete certainty) if the served community stops using it,
> so it has total commercial accountability to the community.

Hi Dirk,
I don=E2=80=99t think Openreach+Retail ISP meets my straw man definition of
user-extensibility. At a casual glance I do not see how a customer of an
ordinary retail ISP in the UK will be able to add network segments such
that the new segments take on the same characteristics (ex: IP addressing,
routing) and the new users can in turn add additional segments and so
forth. Please correct me if I am wrong.

That said, there is more to GAIA than community networks.
Thanks,
-rohan

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Hi Everyone,<u></u><u></u></p><div><p class=3D"MsoNo=
rmal"><br>Just to briefly introduce myself, my most relevant experience to =
this group is that I helped build a large portion of a long-range 5Ghz WiFi=
 backbone in Haiti with Inveneo; before that I was an active participant in=
 the IETF in the RAI space for many years; currently I work as a field logi=
stician for an international non-profit in South Kivu, Democratic Republic =
of Congo.<u></u><u></u></p>
</div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal"><u></u>=C2=A0<u></u></p></div><div><p cla=
ss=3D"MsoNormal">To me the key difference between FON and what the authors =
call a community network is the ability to actively enlarge the network. FO=
N capitalizes on an existing network. It does not extend that network, it m=
erely allows reciprocal access to that network by individual nodes. While t=
his is already a good and useful thing, I think what many of the authors of=
 the draft want to define is a user-extensible network. Below is my strawma=
n definition.<u></u><u></u></p>
</div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal"><u></u>=C2=A0<u></u></p></div><div><p cla=
ss=3D"MsoNormal">User-extensible network: A network in which any participan=
t in the system may add link segments to the network in such a way that the=
 new network segments can support multiple nodes and adopt the same overall=
 characteristics as those of the joined network, including the capacity to =
further extend the network. Once these link segments are joined to the netw=
ork, there is no longer a meaningful distinction between the previous exten=
t of the network and the new extent of the network.=C2=A0<u></u><u></u></p>
</div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal"><u></u>=C2=A0<u></u></p></div><div><p cla=
ss=3D"MsoNormal">Note that this covers a large part of the Free Network Fou=
ndation&#39;s Freedom 1 as posted by Roger, but not all of it.<u></u><u></u=
></p>
</div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal"><u></u>=C2=A0<u></u></p></div><div><p cla=
ss=3D"MsoNormal">Practically I think this means that new segments of a user=
-extensible network do not involve IP address translation at the boundary o=
f the network. This is important architecturally, so if someone has a good =
counter-example, please respond.<u></u><u></u></p>
</div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal"><u></u>=C2=A0<u></u></p></div><div><p cla=
ss=3D"MsoNormal">For me it does not matter if the network is wired or wirel=
ess, licensed or unlicensed spectrum, or what technologies are used. It doe=
s not matter if the network has a fee structure or who administers the netw=
ork. I agree with Steve that commercial extensible networks should be inclu=
ded. In Haiti and the parts of sub-Saharan Africa where I have lived (Benin=
, South Sudan, DRC) a commercial entity has a better chance of getting off =
the ground.=C2=A0<u></u><u></u></p>

Hi Arjuna, All,
I think that community networks are a very important part of GAIA, but I
can think of non-community approaches (ex: traditional mobile operator
using balloons) that I think are in scope for GAIA, and community-networks
that are not relevant to GAIA (ex: special-purpose hobbyist networks or
temporary event-specific networks). As Roger pointed out, Internet access
is a service and not every community network necessarily includes Internet
access.

After seeing more of the discussions I thought about proposing some
additional definitions. I reworded the second half of Paul Aoki=E2=80=99s
definition for a community network (Thanks Paul) because I think it stands
alone. I don=E2=80=99t think community members need to contribute active ne=
twork
devices to make it a community network. I am curious what everyone else
thinks.

*Organizational Input/Control*
Community Network:
A network where community members have an obvious and direct form of
organizational control over the overall operation of the network, above and
beyond their own participation in the network.

*Ownership*
User-owned:
Owned by the users of the service collectively.

Community-owned:
Owned by an entity (whether government, cooperative, non-profit, or
for-profit) which is economically accountable to the community.

*Extensibility*
User-extensible network:
A network in which any participant in the system may add link segments to
the network in such a way that the new network segments can support
multiple nodes and adopt the same overall characteristics as those of the
joined network, including the capacity to further extend the network. Once
these link segments are joined to the network, there is no longer a
meaningful distinction between the previous extent of the network and the
new extent of the network.

I hope these are useful and provoke more discussion.
Thanks,
-rohan

<br>
So from the different replies and also from what I envision - this is<br>
what I get -<br>
<br>
1/Community networks are formed because the traditional network<br>
operator has failed to provide coverage through equipment deployment<br>
and/or failed to provide affordable services to a community.<br>
<br>
2/The community now takes matter into its own hands - joins together<br>
to form an entity &quot;or&quot; there could be another entity that is keen=
 to<br>
support the community stepping into help and support - so this is not<br>
the traditional NO - but someone like the local govt, charitable<br>
organisation or a local business. The latter entity may have some<br>
benefit: social, economical, environmental et al.<br>
<br>
So my question here is would the latter be classified as a community<br>
network or something else.<br>
<br>
&gt;From what I see from Paul&#39;s reply, the latter will not be classifie=
d<br>
as a community network since the local community do have any form of<br>
control there.<br>
<br>
BUT - I also see from Steve and Rohan&#39;s reply and Paul also agrees<br>
that we should not discount &quot;for-profit&quot; initiatives which means =
the<br>
local community may not have any control in such an entity.<br>
<br>
So from all this the way I decipher the message that we need to be<br>
more inclusive:<br>
<br>
Community networks are networks that are<br>
<br>
1/decentralised and formed because the traditional network operator<br>
has failed to provide coverage through equipment deployment and/or<br>
failed to provide affordable services to a community.<br>
2/locally owned within the community with community members directly<br>
contributing to active network infrastructure to extend then network<br>
and having some form of organisational control<br>
3/Or owned by an entity that is not the traditional network operator<br>
that has specific interests in supporting the community either for<br>
profit or non-profit<br>
4/Can be both wired and/or wireless.<br>
<br>
Does that sound right? I am not sure what Leandro thinks of point (3) :).<b=

As it=92s been said, this is around a discussion to define community =
networks, being around for so many years, but there are many other =
models in GAIA. No need to overload the term. But definitely it will be =
great to report on other examples, and also about promising new ideas, =
to have a board basis on how to fulfil the aims expressed in GAIA.

Failure is not a prerequisite, diversity can be nice, less risky and =
more sustainable / resilient.=20
Sometimes CN emerge because people like to have alternatives for many =
reasons. Decentralisation is the result of being participatory and have =
defined rules.

> and having some form of organisational control
Local ownership can be a form of openness for participation (for profit =
or not). In my opinion that is key for local development, =
sustainability, resilience.

> 3/Or owned by an entity that is not the traditional network operator

Not sure what ownership means here. If I am free to extend the network =
from my home and I buy the devices, I feel I own my network segment, as =
part of the community :-)

> 4/Can be both wired and/or wireless.
Sure, affordable technology and open regulations: + open spectrum in =
wireless, and "open trenches=94 or pipes in wired, lower the barrier of =
participation and growth.

>=20
> Does that sound right? I am not sure what Leandro thinks of point (3) =
:).
My conclusions about the discussion is that the most relevant aspect of =
the community networks that I know is their effectiveness in enhancing =
and extending digital Internet rights following a participatory model.

a) are local network/communications infrastructures (can expand to new =
locations, can create alternatives in places already served).

b) follow an open participatory model that define the rules of the =
community for extension, operation (like net neutrality define the =
common/public carrier model, community licences define rules for =
expanding the network and peering) and decision making in general. In an =
equivalent context: the rules of a democracy with citizens, compared to =
a closed business with consumers. This does not impose or exclude profit =
or business (think about Libre software, also participatory and with =
licenses).

c) as network infrastructure can provide services: can interconnect to =
the Internet (IP everywhere), and provide other services, such as Web, =
VOIP (voice everywhere), storage, (local) content distribution, sensors, =
etc.


For me (a) differentiates community networks (anyone can start creating =
digital infrastructures expanding the geographic coverage, with the =
potential of reaching anywhere) from community-provided Internet access =
(from the personal perspective of sharing access, e.g. via open WiFi, to =
existing infrastructure to find more open Internet service opportunities =
for people around) (local network construction, vs sharing wireless =
Internet access).

a) and b) lead to the model of commons infrastructure and its rules or =
community license (tacit or explicit) that defines an open participation =
model (anyone, including commercial entities, can start or join under =
rules defined by the community itself. This can be called a market, as =
profit and fees are not excluded). That=92s why they're also called =
"bottom-up networks".

Services in c) show the difference between Internet access (a service) =
and the local network infrastructure (a pre-requisite, that can be =
satisfied in many ways), although could also come together.


Therefore community networks are about cooperative/participatory =
developments of network infrastructure (can be a good business =
opportunity too). Comparably with FOSS (Libre sw), anyone can start one, =
the model does not exclude participation from any person or business as =
long as it follows the community license. As with FOSS, CN are =
complementary to other development and usage models.

As Dirk said, the separation may seem odd when you just use the service, =
but the real fun is in the participation on the construction, operation, =
governance :-)
As Rohan said, there is more to GAIA than community networks :-)

One difficulty in this discussion (as several participants point out) is =
that we are combining:

- technologies relevant to GAIA (wireless, fibre, mesh, balloons, =
satellites, pigeons, uav),=20

- regulation models relevant to GAIA (e.g. open spectrum, ISP regs), (As =
Steve mentioned)

- organisational or governance models (open communities, hierarchies, =
markets)=20

All this can be combined in many ways to achieve sustainable =
socio-economic profit, and ensure everyone has a chance/right to be part =
of the digital world.The resulting specific instances have their own =
names and can be grouped under terms such as community networks, open =
wifi services, user-extensible services, traditional local ISP, new =
global ISP. This discussion and the GAIA work will definitely help to =
clarify this much better.=20

Thanks Arjuna and everyone in GAIA for this effort.

Leandro.

Hi all, this conversation is very interesting indeed.

As Rohan, I disagree with the community members having to actively
contribute to the infrastructure. In the community network I am assisting
to build up in rural South Africa
<http://villagetelco.org/deployments/nyandeni-south-africa/>, the
"community" has been there way long before the network was conceived.
However, its members due to the lack of electricity and economic resources,
among other social constraints, can not easily contribute to the
infrastructure. In this scenario, we expect these members to contribute
highly to the financial sustainability of the network by using it via
public access set-ups, hotspots or public phones, etc. Furthermore, these
users are actively involved in the decision making of the network
(organized as non-profit cooperative, for the sake of being able to do this
legally as Steve pointed out, where all users are cooperative members).

Roger's definition of ownership might also be a point of dissent. Being an
externally initiated initiative, those hosting the APs that build the
infrastructure do not own them, they were just selected by the community to
do so. In the event of using other external grants (public of private, as
it is been the case of all documented community networks in rural areas of
developing countries) the ownership model in these scenarios might be
different than in most places where community networks have thrilled.
However, different licences can accommodate different scenarios and
ownership models. As in guifi.net, the licence (in our case not written
anywhere due to the oral tradition here) has been key for the social
consolidation of this initiative, as it keeps everyone on the same level of
understanding.

Although I agree with the comment about "Internet access is a service and
not every community network necessarily includes Internet access.", then
other alternatives as community cellular networks should be mentioned here
(I didn't include them initially because of the internet service
requirement). However, although I see two OpenBTS being connected to each
other to increase service coverage and meet the requirement of network
extensibility, this is very unlikely to be done by a single user alone due
to the cost requirements, and so reinforcing my points above about
community ownership and usage, rather than based on the individuals.

I also wanted to clarify what I meant by non-profit, which is a concept
that is sometimes misunderstood. A non-profit can generate profit to keep
the services operational, the difference is that the surplus must be
reinvested in the goals of the non-profit instead of going to generate
profit for the investors. That way we have articulated our initiative, so
people working on providing and maintaining the services can be paid, but
if there is surplus on top of it, its reinvested in community development
projects (being extending the network and its services a potential one).
Although this is a WiP, I tend to see this type of entity having more
developmental return into the community and their social structures, in
terms of resilience, for instance, than the local entrepreneurship model.
But again, this is not and either or, and different models should be used
in different contexts depending on what the community members decide.

Hope it helps showing a different perspective to the discussion.

&gt;<br>
&gt; Does that sound right? I am not sure what Leandro thinks of point (3) =
:).<br>
</div>My conclusions about the discussion is that the most relevant aspect =
of the community networks that I know is their effectiveness in enhancing a=
nd extending digital Internet rights following a participatory model.<br>

<br>
a) are local network/communications infrastructures (can expand to new loca=
tions, can create alternatives in places already served).<br>
<br>
b) follow an open participatory model that define the rules of the communit=
y for extension, operation (like net neutrality define the common/public ca=
rrier model, community licences define rules for expanding the network and =
peering) and decision making in general. In an equivalent context: the rule=
s of a democracy with citizens, compared to a closed business with consumer=
s. This does not impose or exclude profit or business (think about Libre so=
ftware, also participatory and with licenses).<br>

<br>
c) as network infrastructure can provide services: can interconnect to the =
Internet (IP everywhere), and provide other services, such as Web, VOIP (vo=
ice everywhere), storage, (local) content distribution, sensors, etc.<br>

<br>
<br>
For me (a) differentiates community networks (anyone can start creating dig=
ital infrastructures expanding the geographic coverage, with the potential =
of reaching anywhere) from community-provided Internet access (from the per=
sonal perspective of sharing access, e.g. via open WiFi, to existing infras=
tructure to find more open Internet service opportunities for people around=
) (local network construction, vs sharing wireless Internet access).<br>

<br>
a) and b) lead to the model of commons infrastructure and its rules or comm=
unity license (tacit or explicit) that defines an open participation model =
(anyone, including commercial entities, can start or join under rules defin=
ed by the community itself. This can be called a market, as profit and fees=
 are not excluded). That=E2=80=99s why they&#39;re also called &quot;bottom=
-up networks&quot;.<br>

<br>
Services in c) show the difference between Internet access (a service) and =
the local network infrastructure (a pre-requisite, that can be satisfied in=
 many ways), although could also come together.<br>
<br>
<br>
Therefore community networks are about cooperative/participatory developmen=
ts of network infrastructure (can be a good business opportunity too). Comp=
arably with FOSS (Libre sw), anyone can start one, the model does not exclu=
de participation from any person or business as long as it follows the comm=
unity license. As with FOSS, CN are complementary to other development and =
usage models.<br>

<br>
As Dirk said, the separation may seem odd when you just use the service, bu=
t the real fun is in the participation on the construction, operation, gove=
rnance :-)<br>
As Rohan said, there is more to GAIA than community networks :-)<br>
<br>
One difficulty in this discussion (as several participants point out) is th=
at we are combining:<br>
<br>
- technologies relevant to GAIA (wireless, fibre, mesh, balloons, satellite=
s, pigeons, uav),<br>
<br>
- regulation models relevant to GAIA (e.g. open spectrum, ISP regs), (As St=
eve mentioned)<br>
<br>
- organisational or governance models (open communities, hierarchies, marke=
ts)<br>
<br>
All this can be combined in many ways to achieve sustainable socio-economic=
 profit, and ensure everyone has a chance/right to be part of the digital w=
orld.The resulting specific instances have their own names and can be group=
ed under terms such as community networks, open wifi services, user-extensi=
ble services, traditional local ISP, new global ISP. This discussion and th=
e GAIA work will definitely help to clarify this much better.<br>

<br>
Thanks Arjuna and everyone in GAIA for this effort.<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Abstract:<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; =C2=A0 Several communities have developed initiatives to b=
uild large scale,<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; =C2=A0 self-organized and decentralized community wireless=
 networks that use<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; =C2=A0 wireless technologies (including long distance) due=
 to the reduced<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; =C2=A0 cost of using the unlicensed spectrum. =C2=A0This c=
an be motivated by<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; =C2=A0 different causes: Sometimes the reluctance, or the =
impossibility, of<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; =C2=A0 network operators to provide wired and cellular inf=
rastructures to<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; =C2=A0 rural/remote areas has motivated the rise of these =
networks. =C2=A0Some<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; =C2=A0 other times, they are built as a complement and an =
alternative to<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; =C2=A0 wired Internet access.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; =C2=A0 These community wireless networks have self sustain=
able business<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; =C2=A0 models that provide more localised communication se=
rvices as well as<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; =C2=A0 providing Internet backhaul support through peering=
 agreements with<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; =C2=A0 traditional network operators who see such communit=
y led networks as<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; =C2=A0 a way to extend their reach to rural/remote areas a=
t lower cost.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; =C2=A0 This document defines these networks, summarizes th=
eir technological<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; =C2=A0 characteristics and classifies them, also talking a=
bout their socio-<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; =C2=A0 economic sustainability models.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; =C2=A0 There exist other networks, also based on sharing w=
ireless resources<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; =C2=A0 of the users, but not built upon the initiative of =

Hi all,
 
I am following the (very interesting) discussion about the "definition" of
Community Networks, and the problem of which kinds of networks should be
included and excluded from the draft.
 
Just a thought: The current title of the document is "Community Networks.
Definition and taxonomy". However, we can avoid the words "Community
Networks" from the title, if we finally agree on including other things that
some of us consider as CNs and others do not. The draft will only be
successful if we reach a broad consensus.
 
I mean, we have this degree of freedom: if we want to write a draft with a
broader scope, we can consider CNs just as a subdomain of something wider.
Some examples:
 
"Networks where resources are shared"
"Networks where users have the initiative"
"Locally owned"
"Open"
"Networks that fit the objectives of GAIA"
.
 
Jose

not sure - but my thinking would be this is Cisco Investments - so the aim
would be to make profits on their investments. For a community wifi startup
type project, probably best to look for ISOC community grants:
http://www.internetsociety.org/what-we-do/grants-awards/community-grants

Google.org may also be an option. There are folks here who have received
grants from Google.org (for e.g the denovogroup).

You could also ask Jim Forster for suggestions.

Thanks Arjuna

I agree that multinational corporations don't make good partners

I am thinnking of a sustainable social enterprise (here in India) with
no  uprfont startup capital
using/testing/prototyping the models in the draft being circulated

but a grant  to help us set ups shop would be good

any social capital investors  on this list interested in chipping in,
also as advisors
please ping :-)

(anyone else from this list is in Ladakh this month, lets connect :-)

another possible way could be to apply for a research grant via DST to
setup a deployment and proposing to study some behaviour (usage for
instance and deciphering new sustainable models for e.g.) -

you could probably talk to Prof HS Jamadagni from Indian Institute of
Science for advice about this - he is in the GAIA list.

Hi all,
 
I have tried to extract the main ideas from the discussion in the list, and
I have built this document.
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67016195/discussion_CN_def_v1.docx
 
As you can see, there are lots of contributions in the list, from people
with wide experience.
 
 
In my opinion, the first problem to solve is the scope of the draft. From my
point of view, there are three different ways:
 
1- Writing a very broad document including
"all-the-networks-we-are-talking-about-here", and then classifying them.
Community Networks would become a section of the document, and could be
distinguished from other approaches.
 
In this case we should remove the words "Community Networks" from the title,
and try to find a "broad name" including everything. What about a "negative
definition"?: something similar to NGO: like "non-operator networks" or
"non-conventional networks". Perhaps "user-centric networks" can also fit.
 
 
2- Writing a number of documents: one about community networks, other about
FON-like networks, etc.
 
This option is really difficult: it will be impossible to find consensus
when defining the borders between different network models.
 
 
3- Assuming that this is an impossible task. Let's forget about a
definition.
 
I think this is not an option. The objective of GAIA is writing good
documents about these things.
 
 
 
Jose Saldana

i think we should do (1): use the current feedback to revise and get
more contributors onboard. But I am not sure why you are proposing to
change the title of the doc? its like changing the original
vision/goal and from the discussions so far - i dont think thats what
the members suggested - its more about making the classification more
inclusive.
