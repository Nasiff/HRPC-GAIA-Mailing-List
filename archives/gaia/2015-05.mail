Hi all,

The Call for Papers for ACM DEV 2015 is out and is also attached.

As a new thing this year, there will be multiple submission tracks
that focus on different aspects of computing for development:
a. Systems Track
b. HCI Track
c. Data Science Track
d. General track
e. Short papers track

Check out:
http://acmdev.org

Submission Deadline: July 15, 2015.

Do consider submitting and definitely spread the word. We would like
to broaden the scope of ACM DEV to attract a larger and broader array
of audience.

cheers
lakshmi

Call for Papers

DEV 2015 provides an international forum for research in the design,
implementation, and evaluation of information and communication
technologies (ICTs) for social and economic development. In
particular, we focus on contexts where conventional computing
solutions are often inappropriate due to various contextual factors -
including, but not limited to: cost, language, literacy, and the
availability of power and bandwidth.

The topic of ICT for development is inherently multidisciplinary, and
encompasses a broad array of fields within the computer science
discipline. The ACM DEV conference is an opportunity for researchers
across these diverse fields of computer science to come together to
work on the common problem of improving access to and availability of
information and communication technology solutions. In an effort to
encourage participation of researchers across the relevant domains,
this year the DEV conference introduces submissions =E2=80=9Ctracks=E2=80=
=9D. The
focus of the conference is research at the interface of computer
science and development related to (but not limited to) the following
three non-exclusive focus areas:

Systems
HCI and Applications
Data Science

We are committed to accepting papers of the very highest quality on
the interface between computer science and development. Authors can
designate a paper for one or two of these focus areas. Each area has
dedicated Program Committee (PC) members to allow appropriate review
of papers. Papers will be automatically referred to another track or
reviewed by PC members from different tracks where appropriate. The
conference itself will have sessions grouped by topic rather than by
area. Example topics within focus areas include:

Systems Track

Low-cost connectivity and computing devices
Network solutions for poorly connected regions, including white space
spectrum
Power-efficient systems
Mobile systems and applications
Special-purpose systems, e.g., sensors, wireless, IVR
Systems challenges and opportunities in development, e.g., security,
sustainability, resilience
Cellular phone systems and applications
Novel tools and applications for development
Measurements of existing technology in developing regions (e.g.
network deployments)

HCI Track

User interfaces for low-literacy populations
Multi-lingual computing
User interfaces for low-cost devices
Participatory methods and user-centered design
Accessibility to disabled populations in developing regions
Design and evaluation of applications in health, microfinance,
education, agriculture, entertainment, social media
Adapting content and applications to local languages and education levels
Understanding social relationships and information flows in
disadvantaged societies

Data Science Track

Computational sustainability
Computational social science
Econometric models and developmental economics
Data science for social good
Machine learning techniques for large-scale data analysis in
development contexts
Speech interfaces and translation for low-resource languages
Computer vision challenges and opportunities in development
Understanding social networks and digital media in developing regions

General Track

We welcome papers outside of the above topics that address the DEV
focus on computing innovations supporting social and economic
development.

Papers should describe original and previously unpublished research.
Three metrics will be applied to judge the submissions: (a) Relevance
of the problem for development; (b) Novelty of the ideas; (c)
Evaluation of the solution, making a case for development-focused
impact. All DEV paper submissions should either provide or directly
motivate a novel technical solution that has direct implications for
development.

Full papers must not exceed 9 pages and all submissions must be in ACM
format, submitted as a PDF. Submissions should be fully anonymized. In
particular, the names or affiliations of authors should not be
included so as to allow for blind review. Papers should be submitted
via the submission site. As part of the submission process, please
indicate one or more tracks for which your submission is best suited.

Short Papers on Practical Experiences

This year ACM DEV introduces a =E2=80=9Cshort paper=E2=80=9D submissions tr=
ack to
target practical field and/or deployment experience, as well as
updates or follow-ups to previously published work. Short papers
should be 2 pages in length, and should convey work or conclusions
that are a direct result of field experience. Papers accepted into the
short paper track will be presented in the conference, but will not
appear in the conference proceedings. It is hoped that these papers
will foster sharing of best practices and/or lessons learned as well
as serve as interesting points for discussion during the conference.
We particularly encourage submissions from practitioners, NGOs, and
others with field experience. Note that these short papers are not
posters, but are presentations.

Important Dates

All times noted are per Pacific Standard Time (PST). Please be sure to
translate to your local time accordingly.

Paper Submission Deadline: July 15 11:59pm, 2015
Acceptance Notification: September 15, 2015
Conference Program: November 30, 2015

Call for papers
  II Workshop pr=C3=A9 IETF/IRTF Introduction and Objectives

The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) (http://www.ietf.org) is an
international community interested in fulfilling the mission of defining
standards that impact the design, use and management of Internet resources
[RFC3935 (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3935.txt)]. The process of
establishing standards for the Internet is long, complex and requires
active participation, particularly of students and researchers. There are
many people around the world actively working on it, however there is a
growing need for more fresh participation.

The attendance from Latin America has been very low, as many potential
targeted participants do not know about the IETF or were not motivated to
do so. A group of volunteers emerged from the "IETF LAC list" to build this
Workshop, aiming to increase Latin American presence in IETF processes.
Besides outreaching about IETF, it is important to provide an environment
that allows our technicians, students and researchers to show their skills,
in advance of any IETF meeting.

The papers presented at the workshop will be adapted or supplemented if
necessary, and forwarded to the IETF, with effective support (by the
Committee Pos Workshop) to increase Latin American participation.
 Format

The event, which will last for one (1) day will consist of technical
sessions with submitting articles, panels, lectures, workshops and
dissemination of works associated with the IETF and IRTF, the Universities
and Research Centers. Technical sessions will consist of presentations of
complete works, or being finalized. They should follow the standard format
SBC (in Spanish, English or Portuguese), with a maximum of 15 pages or 6
pages (*position papers*).

A new type of work can be presented, in order to promote projects and
research carried out in various areas of education and research
institutions of Latin American countries, which coincide directly with the
interests of the IETF, IRTF and ISOC, including participation in the annual
meetings. These dissemination works will also be submitted to the Program
Committee and, with a maximum of 20 pages, but will not be published in the
Proceedings of the CSBC but as a special collection. Must be written in
English only, the presentation may be in English, Spanish or Portuguese.
The format is free, consisting at least the *Abstract*, *Introduction* and
references to sections of the institution, under which projects are
allocated, including e-mail contacts of these sectors and human resources
involved and respective chairs. It would be desirable identify activities
related to other standards institutions were identified (IEEE, W3C, etc.).

In addition to the technical work will be at least a talk with a guest from
outside Brazil, a panel and meetings of working groups to be defined before
(in the IETF LAC group) and during the event. At the closing session,
discussions will be synthesized and selected to form an agenda for the
large group gathered in the IETF LAC, future similar meetings and for the
IETF meetings. For the attendees during the CSBC 2015, every day there will
be groups complementing the discussions that could not be completed on the
day of the workshop, with monitoring of the IETF LAC list (whose entry is
free in https://mail.lacnic.net/mailman/listinfo/ietf-lac}).

    <h3>Introduction and Objectives</h3>
    <p>The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) (<a href=3D"http://www.ie=
tf.org" target=3D"_blank">http://www.ietf.org</a>)
      is an international community interested in fulfilling the mission
      of defining standards that impact the design, use and management
      of Internet resources [RFC3935 (<a href=3D"http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rf=
c3935.txt" target=3D"_blank">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3935.txt</a>)].

      The process of establishing standards for the Internet is long,
      complex and requires active participation, particularly of
      students and researchers. There are many people around the world
      actively working on it, however there is a growing need for more
      fresh participation.</p>
    <p>The attendance from Latin America has been very low, as many
      potential targeted participants do not know about the IETF or were
      not motivated to do so. A group of volunteers emerged from the
      &quot;IETF LAC list&quot; to build this Workshop, aiming to increase =
Latin
      American presence in IETF processes. Besides outreaching about
      IETF, it is important to provide an environment that allows our
      technicians, students and researchers to show their skills, in
      advance of any IETF meeting.</p>
    <p>The papers presented at the workshop will be adapted or
      supplemented if necessary, and forwarded to the IETF, with
      effective support (by the Committee Pos Workshop) to increase
      Latin American participation.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Format</h2>
    <p>The event, which will last for one (1) day will consist of
      technical sessions with submitting articles, panels, lectures,
      workshops and dissemination of works associated with the IETF and
      IRTF, the Universities and Research Centers. Technical sessions
      will consist of presentations of complete works, or being
      finalized. They should follow the standard format SBC (in Spanish,
      English or Portuguese), with a maximum of 15 pages or 6 pages (<em>po=
sition
        papers</em>). </p>
    <p> A new type of work can be presented, in order to promote
      projects and research carried out in various areas of education
      and research institutions of Latin American countries, which
      coincide directly with the interests of the IETF, IRTF and ISOC,
      including participation in the annual meetings. These
      dissemination works will also be submitted to the Program
      Committee and, with a maximum of 20 pages, but will not be
      published in the Proceedings of the CSBC but as a special
      collection. Must be written in English only, the presentation may
      be in English, Spanish or Portuguese. The format is free,
      consisting at least the <em>Abstract</em>, <em>Introduction</em>
      and references to sections of the institution, under which
      projects are allocated, including e-mail contacts of these sectors
      and human resources involved and respective chairs. It would be
      desirable identify activities related to other standards
      institutions were identified (IEEE, W3C, etc.). </p>
    <p> In addition to the technical work will be at least a talk with a

No comments on my personal stance on this issue.  But if this is a topic
you're interested in exploring, happy to start up a working group to put
together a paper+study?

*An Open Letter to Mark Zuckerberg Regarding Internet.org, Net Neutrality,
Privacy, and Security*

[If you have comments, please add them below the letter]
We, the undersigned, a coalition XXX organizations from around the world,
share
a common concern about the launch and expansion of Facebook=E2=80=99s Inter=
net.org
platform and its implications for the open internet around the world. It is
our belief that Facebook is improperly defining Net Neutrality in public
statements and building a walled-garden where the world's poorest people
can only access a limited set of insecure websites and services. Further,
we are deeply concerned that Internet.org has been misleadingly marketed as
providing access to the internet, when in fact it only provides access to a
limited number of internet-connected services.

In addition, in its present conception, Internet.org not only violates
fundamental principles of Net Neutrality, but also threatens freedom of
expression, security, privacy, and innovation.

Net Neutrality supports freedom of expression by enabling people to seek,
receive, and impart information. It requires that the internet be
maintained as an open platform on which network providers treat all
content, applications, and services equally, without discrimination. An
important aspect of Net Neutrality states that everyone should be able to
innovate without permission from anyone or any entity.

This includes prohibiting =E2=80=9Cpositive discrimination,=E2=80=9D which =
covers price
differentiation schemes like zero rating.

Zero rating is the practice by service providers of offering a specific set
of services or applications that do not count against data caps. These
practices are inherently discriminatory and do not treat all content or
applications equally =E2=80=94 which is why they have been banned in countr=
ies such
as the Netherlands and Chile. Zero rating agreements endanger freedom of
expression by letting service providers decide which services will be
privileged over others, thus interfering with the free flow of information
over networks. Zero rating is currently Internet.org's basic model:
Facebook is partnering with ISPs around the world to offer access to certai=
n
applications to users at no cost.

In a May 4 video, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced new rules
pertaining to Internet.org and argued that Net Neutrality and Internet.org
are not in conflict. However, on the accompanying website, the new rules
explicitly state that =E2=80=9Cwebsites must be properly integrated with
Internet.org to allow zero rating.=E2=80=9D

Internet.org misleadingly labels these zero-rated applications the
=E2=80=9Cinternet,=E2=80=9D when in fact the applications only offer access=
 to a tiny
portion of it. The project acts as a "walled garden" in which some services
are favored over others =E2=80=94 again, a violation of Net Neutrality.

The project raises other freedom of expression risks. The censorship
capability of internet gateways is well established -- governments often go
to ISPs to block access to certain sites or services. Facebook appears to
be putting itself in a similar position, where governments could pressure
the company to block certain content, or even, if users must log in for
access, block individual users. The company should not take on this added
responsibility and risk by creating a single chokepoint for the free flow
of information.

We are also deeply concerned about the privacy implications of
Internet.org. Facebook=E2=80=99s privacy policy does not provide adequate
protections for new users to the internet. Given the lack of statements to
the contrary, it is likely Internet.org collects data by its users when
they utilize the apps and services that are part of the program, and there
is a lack of transparency about how that data is used by Internet.org and
its telco partners. Internet.org also concentrates internet usage in a
handful of applications and services, making it easier for governments and
malicious actors to surveil user traffic.

Finally, the current implementation of Internet.org threatens the security
of users. The May 4 update to the program prohibits the use of TLS
(Transport Layer Security), Secure Socket Layer (SSL) or HTTPS encryption
by participating services. This inherently puts users at risk, because
their web traffic will be vulnerable to malicious attacks and, potentially,
government eavesdropping.

We urge Facebook to assert its support for a true definition of Net
Neutrality in which ALL applications and services are treated equally and
without discrimination =E2=80=94 especially in the developing world, where =
the next
three billion Internet users are coming online =E2=80=94 and to address the
significant privacy and security flaws inherent in the current iteration of
Internet.org.

Facebook should strongly support and advocate for safeguarding the
principle of Net Neutrality and other user rights in its discussions with
national governments and regulators, while also applying these standards to
its business initiatives.

Signed,

Hi all,

With all the buzz in India lately about net neutrality and zero rating, I
am curious to understand what are the actual economics behind this game.
Tried doing some rough calculations.

Some numbers I heard through friends in the industry was that Flipkart, an
online retailer like Amazon, was paying the cellular provider Airtel a flat
rate of INR 88,000,000 per month to zero rate access to Flipkart.

And Flipkart published a separate statistic some time back that it was
doing 5M deliveries a month, and that 20% of its orders were from mobile
phones. Doing a very crude approximation assuming that each delivery was
via a new transaction, this implies some 1M transactions per month on
mobile.

An INR 88M zero rating fees for 1M successful transactions is INR 88 per
transaction or roughly $1.5. From Flipkart's perspective, this might be a
bit aggressive, it will eat into their margins and assuming an average
transaction value of $15 or so, it may pinch. Flipkart btw does free
delivery for transactions over INR 500 or $8.

>From Airtel's perspective, this revenue is required to subsidize the mobile
app access cost of this user. Assuming say 5MB data per user session and
that a purchase might be made in only one out of 10 sessions, this means
for 50MB of data for each purchase Flipkart is paying $1.5. This seems very
high given that in India a 1GB 3G data plan comes for INR 250 for a month,
or $4 approx. So 50MB of access only costs the telco ~ 20c or so, but for
which they are charging $1.5 from Flipkart. It's quite a steal for the
telcos it seems!

These numbers however are mostly unofficial and there are some big
assumptions as well, so I don't know how valid the calculation really is.
Any insights that others have in the matter?

I also wonder what the Internet.org economics might be like?

Aadi

Melissa - I think this is an interesting topic that could be explored
within the context of GAIA too. Happy to support this. You may want to talk
to Steve Song?

Do you want to talk about this at the IETF in Prague? or at the DEV GAIA
workshop in London?

*An Open Letter to Mark Zuckerberg Regarding Internet.org, Net Neutrality,<=
br>
Privacy, and Security*<br>
<br>
[If you have comments, please add them below the letter]<br>
We, the undersigned, a coalition XXX organizations from around the world, s=
hare<br>
a common concern about the launch and expansion of Facebook=E2=80=99s Inter=
net.org<br>
platform and its implications for the open internet around the world. It is=
<br>
our belief that Facebook is improperly defining Net Neutrality in public<br=
>
statements and building a walled-garden where the world&#39;s poorest peopl=
e<br>
can only access a limited set of insecure websites and services. Further,<b=
r>
we are deeply concerned that Internet.org has been misleadingly marketed as=
<br>
providing access to the internet, when in fact it only provides access to a=
<br>
limited number of internet-connected services.<br>
<br>
In addition, in its present conception, Internet.org not only violates<br>
fundamental principles of Net Neutrality, but also threatens freedom of<br>
expression, security, privacy, and innovation.<br>
<br>
Net Neutrality supports freedom of expression by enabling people to seek,<b=
r>
receive, and impart information. It requires that the internet be<br>
maintained as an open platform on which network providers treat all<br>
content, applications, and services equally, without discrimination. An<br>
important aspect of Net Neutrality states that everyone should be able to<b=
r>
innovate without permission from anyone or any entity.<br>
<br>
This includes prohibiting =E2=80=9Cpositive discrimination,=E2=80=9D which =
covers price<br>
differentiation schemes like zero rating.<br>
<br>
Zero rating is the practice by service providers of offering a specific set=
<br>
of services or applications that do not count against data caps. These<br>
practices are inherently discriminatory and do not treat all content or<br>
applications equally =E2=80=94 which is why they have been banned in countr=
ies such<br>
as the Netherlands and Chile. Zero rating agreements endanger freedom of<br=
>
expression by letting service providers decide which services will be<br>
privileged over others, thus interfering with the free flow of information<=
br>
over networks. Zero rating is currently Internet.org&#39;s basic model:<br>
Facebook is partnering with ISPs around the world to offer access to certai=
n<br>
applications to users at no cost.<br>
<br>
In a May 4 video, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced new rules<br>
pertaining to Internet.org and argued that Net Neutrality and Internet.org<=
br>
are not in conflict. However, on the accompanying website, the new rules<br=
>
explicitly state that =E2=80=9Cwebsites must be properly integrated with<br=
>
Internet.org to allow zero rating.=E2=80=9D<br>
<br>
Internet.org misleadingly labels these zero-rated applications the<br>
=E2=80=9Cinternet,=E2=80=9D when in fact the applications only offer access=
 to a tiny<br>
portion of it. The project acts as a &quot;walled garden&quot; in which som=
e services<br>
are favored over others =E2=80=94 again, a violation of Net Neutrality.<br>
<br>
The project raises other freedom of expression risks. The censorship<br>
capability of internet gateways is well established -- governments often go=
<br>
to ISPs to block access to certain sites or services. Facebook appears to<b=
r>
be putting itself in a similar position, where governments could pressure<b=
r>
the company to block certain content, or even, if users must log in for<br>
access, block individual users. The company should not take on this added<b=
r>
responsibility and risk by creating a single chokepoint for the free flow<b=
r>
of information.<br>
<br>
We are also deeply concerned about the privacy implications of<br>
Internet.org. Facebook=E2=80=99s privacy policy does not provide adequate<b=
r>
protections for new users to the internet. Given the lack of statements to<=
br>
the contrary, it is likely Internet.org collects data by its users when<br>
they utilize the apps and services that are part of the program, and there<=
br>
is a lack of transparency about how that data is used by Internet.org and<b=
r>
its telco partners. Internet.org also concentrates internet usage in a<br>
handful of applications and services, making it easier for governments and<=
br>
malicious actors to surveil user traffic.<br>
<br>
Finally, the current implementation of Internet.org threatens the security<=
br>
of users. The May 4 update to the program prohibits the use of TLS<br>
(Transport Layer Security), Secure Socket Layer (SSL) or HTTPS encryption<b=
r>
by participating services. This inherently puts users at risk, because<br>
their web traffic will be vulnerable to malicious attacks and, potentially,=
<br>
government eavesdropping.<br>
<br>
We urge Facebook to assert its support for a true definition of Net<br>
Neutrality in which ALL applications and services are treated equally and<b=
r>
without discrimination =E2=80=94 especially in the developing world, where =
the next<br>
three billion Internet users are coming online =E2=80=94 and to address the=
<br>
significant privacy and security flaws inherent in the current iteration of=
<br>
Internet.org.<br>
<br>
Facebook should strongly support and advocate for safeguarding the<br>
principle of Net Neutrality and other user rights in its discussions with<b=
r>
national governments and regulators, while also applying these standards to=
<br>
its business initiatives.<br>

Hi all,
 
Does anyone have information about the versions of 802.11 normally used
nowadays in Community Networks?
 
I am interested in two aspects of this question:
 
- Frequencies: Are the vast majority of the links using the 2.4GHz band? Is
802.11n (and/or 802.11ac) being deployed in these scenarios?
 
- New features: As you may know, the latest versions of the standard (from
802.11n) include new features as e.g. frame aggregation mechanisms (A-MPDU
and A-MSDU). Are these features used in CNs?
 
If people from CNs could give their view, or if there is some information
(research papers, statistics) about this, it would be very useful. This may
perhaps vary depending on the geographical zone.
 
In addition, if you want to have a look to this section of the "Alternative
Networks draft" and give your opinion, it will be welcome:
https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-gaia-alternative-network-deployments-
00#section-4.2.4.1
 
 
Thanks in advance!

Hi,

My experience (and also some literature [1]) says that the majority tend
to use 802.11n radios from ubiquitu/microtik/tplink.

In my experience there is a preference for 5GHz on backhaul links, with

802.11n yes. There are some recent cheap products using 802.11ac so I
guess this will take some momentum.

I think the highest diversity among communities is on the software used
and consequently on the wireless mode used. Some use OpenWRT (which
supports both types of aggregation), while some other use stock firmware
from vendors (and there you have not only aggregation but also
proprietary extensions).

This is changing dramatically, specially since the ac is available in
the market. In some areas 5GHz band is already more saturated than the
2.4GHz.

Passed to the guifi.net coordination mailing list (with a short intro
about GAIA and the relevance of the participation in the
standardisation process because if we want to effectively involve the
communities we must speak their language):

OK, I do not understand how Outernet would work for a primary school.  
If the school that wants 1-5 grade materials, how does the school know 
then Outernet broadcasts the content the school would need or want?  How 
do they know the files size to have enough storage on their sd card?

Have you tested the service yet?  They have a raspberry pi version, 
(http://outernet-project.github.io/orx-install/) that needs a usb 
satellite receiver. Have you set on up yet, I have not been able to get 
one to work as of yet.

  We have just got the proposal for an IEEE Comms magazine special issue
for GAIA accepted - so we will be sending out the CfP very soon. Deadline
for submission would be end of December (tbf). Hoping to get some great
papers from this group.

Excellent and relevant questions Bruce. Yes i think we need bidirectional
access to have efficient delivery of  localised and relevant content.

I'm not so sure, it's possible to index the material (that's a job in
itself) - web search engines do this for instance to decide how to respond
to a request - so sending indexing material may provide the info to help a
receiver decide what it wises to use from the broadcast signal to populate
your local "cache". (We looked at a similar approach in our DART project a
few years ago with respect to providing time-shifted TV content via
satellite.) This style of operation is I think both feasible and scalable.

Of course it goes against the web trend of dynamically rendered content
and directed adverts to specific user profiles, etc, but that may not be
entirely a bad thing! And is anyway less of an issue for the school
example.

CALL FOR PAPERS AND DEMOS

Extreme Conference on Communication and Computing - The Savannah Expedition
ExtremeCom 2015

1-7 August 2015, Kenya

http://www.extremecom.org/

******************************************************************

Scope
-----

The Extreme Conference on Communication and Computing (ExtremeCom) brings
together researchers and practitioners in areas related to communications in
rural, remote or other extreme environments, and computing in extreme
operating conditions such as extreme temperatures and energy constraints,
extreme quantities ("big data"), extremely large-scale systems, and extreme
levels of threat and uncertainty, in order to gain experience and insight
into
the challenges that such environments pose for the network and the users.

We welcome a broad range of topics concerning both technical and economical
aspects, for example wireless communication, mobile computing, low power
devices and protocols, delay tolerant networks and other networking
paradigms,
distributed computing paradigms, big data, distributed systems, cloud
computing, business and services models, user experiences and web
applications. Researches addressing computing challenges in general mobile
environments (even not completely extreme) are also welcomed by the
conference.

Following on from the success of ExtremeCom 2009 - The Midnight Sun
Expedition
in Laponia, Sweden, ExtremeCom 2010 - The Himalayan Expedition in Dharamsala,
India, ExtremeCom 2011 - The Amazon Expedition in Manaus, Brazil, ExtremeCom
2012 - The Swiss Alps Winter Expedition in Zurich, Switzerland, ExtremeCom
2013 - The Volcanic Expedition in the Eyjafjallajkull Volcano region in
Iceland, and ExtremeCom 2015 - The Galapagos Expedition in Ecuador, we
present
the ExtremeCom 2015 edition: The Savannah Expedition. The conference will
start with 3 days of excursions in the amazing nature of the Kenyan savannah.
Along the way, participants will get to see and experience the varying
landscape and its plant and animal life. Additionally, we will visit existing
deployments of networked systems in the area and learn from their experience.
The immersion will not only give a better idea of both the technical and user
requirements of such a harsh environment, but it will also give many
opportunities for informal research discussions between the participants.
Participants that have their own software for scenarios like this will also,
to as great an extent as possible, be encouraged to test and demonstrate it
within this environment. After the excursions, there will be two days of
paper
presentations and demos. Focus will still be on informal research
discussions,
with the hope that the field experience will give participants the ability to
discuss the topics in a new light.

ACM DEV-6, November 30  December 2, 2015
London, England

Call for Papers



The 6th Annual Symposium on Computing for Development (ACM DEV 2015) 
provides an international forum for research in the design, 
implementation, and evaluation of information and communication 
technologies (ICTs) for social and economic development. In particular, 
we focus on contexts where conventional computing solutions are often 
inappropriate due to various contextual factors - including, but not 
limited to: cost, language, literacy, and the availability of power and 
bandwidth.

The topic of ICT for development is inherently multidisciplinary, and 
encompasses a broad array of fields within the computer science 
discipline.  The ACM DEV conference is an opportunity for researchers 
across these diverse fields of computer science to come together to work 
on the common problem of improving access to and availability of 
information and communication technology solutions.  In an effort to 
encourage participation of researchers across the relevant domains, this 
year the DEV conference introduces submissions tracks.  The focus of 
the conference is research at the interface of computer science and 
development related to (but not limited to) the following three 
non-exclusive focus areas:

         Systems

         HCI and Applications

         Data Science

We are committed to accepting papers of the very highest quality on the 
interface between computer science and development. Authors can 
designate a paper for one or two of these focus areas. Each area has 
dedicated Program Committee (PC) members to allow appropriate review of 
papers. Papers will be automatically referred to another track or 
reviewed by PC members from different tracks where appropriate. The 
conference itself will have sessions grouped by topic rather than by 
area. Example topics within focus areas include:


Systems Track

Low-cost connectivity and computing devices
Network solutions for poorly connected regions, including white space 
spectrum
Power-efficient systems
Mobile systems and applications
Special-purpose systems, e.g., sensors, wireless, IVR
Systems challenges and opportunities in development, e.g., security, 
sustainability, resilience
Cellular phone systems and applications
Novel tools and applications for development
Measurements of existing technology in developing regions (e.g. network 
deployments)


HCI Track

User interfaces for low-literacy populations
Multi-lingual computing
User interfaces for low-cost devices
Participatory methods and user-centered design
Accessibility to disabled populations in developing regions
Design and evaluation of applications in health, microfinance, 
education, agriculture, entertainment, social media
Adapting content and applications to local languages and education levels
Understanding social relationships and information flows in 
disadvantaged societies


Data Science Track

Computational sustainability
Computational social science
Econometric models and developmental economics
Data science for social good
Machine learning techniques for large-scale data analysis in development 
contexts
Speech interfaces and translation for low-resource languages
Computer vision challenges and opportunities in development
Understanding social networks and digital media in developing regions

General Track

We welcome papers outside of the above topics that address the DEV focus 
on computing innovations supporting social and economic development.



Papers should describe original and previously unpublished research. 
Three metrics will be applied to judge the submissions: (a) Relevance of 
the problem for development; (b) Novelty of the ideas; (c) Evaluation of 
the solution, making a case for development-focused impact. All DEV 
paper submissions should either provide or directly motivate a novel 
technical solution that has direct implications for development.

Full papers must not exceed 9 pages and all submissions must be in ACM 
format <http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates>, 
submitted as a PDF. Submissions should be fully anonymized. In 
particular, the names or affiliations of authors should not be included 
so as to allow for blind review.  Papers should be submitted via the 
submission site <http://papers.acmdev.org/>.  As part of the submission 
process, please indicate one or more tracks for which your submission is 
best suited.

New: Short Papers on Practical Experiences

This year ACM DEV introduces a short paper submissions track to target 
practical field and/or deployment experience, as well as updates or 
follow-ups to previously published work, and interesting negative 
results.  Short papers should be 2 pages in length, and should convey 
work or conclusions that are a direct result of field experience. 
  Papers accepted into the short paper track will be presented in the 
conference, but will not appear in the conference proceedings.  It is 
hoped that these papers will foster sharing of best practices and/or 
lessons learned as well as serve as interesting points for discussion 
during the conference.  We particularly encourage submissions from 
practitioners, NGOs, and others with field experience.  Note that these 
short papers are not posters, but are presentations.


Important Dates:

Submission Deadline: July 15, 2015 - 11:59pm (PST)
Acceptance Notification: September 15, 2015
Conference: November 30  December 2, 2015 (London, UK)

Hi All!


I=E2=80=99m writing to follow up on Arjuna=E2=80=99s announcement and to sh=
are more details
about the feature topic in the IEEE Communications Magazine. This feature
topic is titled =E2=80=9CWireless Technologies for Development (W4D)=E2=80=
=9D.


Generally speaking, we are interested in all applications of wireless
technologies for development. Topics of interest include:

=E2=80=A2 =E2=80=9CGlobal access to the Internet for all=E2=80=9D (GAIA) us=
ing wireless technologies

=E2=80=A2 Do-it-yourself (DIY) wireless networking (such as community wirel=
ess
networks) for the developing world

=E2=80=A2 Cost-efficient wireless networked systems appropriate for use in
underdeveloped areas

=E2=80=A2 Fault-tolerant resilient wireless networking technologies for the
developing world

=E2=80=A2 Rural/remote area wireless solutions (that can work efficiently w=
ith
resource constraints such as intermittent and unreliable access to power/
networking service)

=E2=80=A2 Simplified network management techniques (including support for
heterogeneous service delivery through multiple solutions)

=E2=80=A2 Using cognitive radio technology and 5G standards (with possible =
native
integration of satellites) for GAIA

=E2=80=A2 Techno-economic issues related to W4D (including development of f=
lexible
pricing and incentive structures as well as new spectrum access models for
wireless)

=E2=80=A2 Techno-political and cultural issues related to using wireless
communications for development

=E2=80=A2 Using emerging networking architectures and future Internet archi=
tectures
[e.g., cloud computing, fog computing, network functions virtualization
(NFV), information centric networking (ICN), software defined networking
(SDN), and delay tolerant networking (DTN)] with wireless technologies for
development.

=E2=80=A2 Using wireless access/ distribution technologies (such as the fol=
lowing)
for development: TV white spaces (TVWS); satellite communications using
advances in geostationary orbit  (GEO) and low-earth orbit (LEO)
satellites; low-cost community networks; cellular technologies (such as
CDMA 450, the open-source OpenBTS, etc.); wireless mesh and sensor
networks; Wi-Fi-Based Long-distance (WiLD) networks; and wireless based
wireless regional access networks (WRANs).


The CFP for our feature topic is available on IEEE Communications Magazine
website at
http://www.comsoc.org/commag/cfp/wireless-technologies-development-w4d. The
submission deadline is December 1st, 2015.

Hello all,

We have put together a short paper on the ethicality of Internet initiative=
s for developing regions. It will be presented at the workshop on Ethics in=
 Networked Systems Research in London later in the summer. We wanted to sha=
re it with you and invite any feedback.

Abstract: There has been a long standing tradition amongst developed nation=
s of influencing, both directly and indirectly, the activities of developin=
g economies. Behind this is one of a range of aims: building/improving livi=
ng standards, bettering the social status of recipient communities, etc. In=
 some cases, this has resulted in prosperous relations, yet often this has =
been seen as the exploitation of a power position or a veneer for other act=
ivities (e.g. to tap into new emerging markets). In this paper, we explore =
whether initiatives to improve Internet connectivity in developing regions =
are always ethical. We draw a list of issues that would aid in formulating =
Internet initiatives that are ethical, effective, and sustainable.

The PDF could be accessed here: http://www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/~elkhatib/Docs/=

Subject: VB: Feedback on Does the Internet deserve everybody?

Dr. Yehia Elkhatib et al.



I got a reminder from Professor M Ud=C3=A9n, LTU about your work on =E2=80=
=9CDoes the
Internet deserve everybody?=E2=80=9D I have read it from my professional
perspective (I=C2=B4m originally from economic field but now doing policy
science research on citizens participation in broadband development in
rural areas).



I understand that you question (in the introduction passage) what economist
learn about growth (see for instance Solow, 1956). Solow=C2=B4s theories aw=
arded
him the Nobel Prize for showing how to trace sources of growth (effects
from *technological change, capital and labour)*. According to those
theories growth in GDP per capita comes from two sources, *capital
accumulation* and *technological progress*. Those theories have been the
base for design of growth policy (and not the least the massive investment
in universities we have experienced). In essence it is still what is taught
at the Economic departments at many Universities about how to create =E2=80=
=9Clong
term growth.=E2=80=9D



Statistics today show that overall growth between 1950 and 1973 was due to
technical progress. A slow-down between 1973 and 2000 came about due to
slow down in technical progress, oil crises etc. Then increase in
GDP/capita in the US since 1995 on-wards seems to come from faster capital
accumulation of capital related to ICT. Note that capital in this sense is
broadband, ICT devices etc. and not capital in the bank.



Now to my observation. When development countries are offered aid (via the
Swedish development Agency (SIDA)) they have a =E2=80=9Cstrong=E2=80=9D say=
 in what to
invest the funds in. As far as I know they have ICT development (broadband
etc.) and technical education / training on top of their wish list. So when
SIDA fund and set up projects =E2=80=9Cbottom-up=E2=80=9D, large amounts la=
nd on ICT or
training / education.  I.e. the beneficiaries and Swedish government are
strongly influenced by Solow in their investment criteria.



What I wonder is, do you propose that SIDA should take a =E2=80=9Cmeritocra=
tic=E2=80=9D
view and suggest other directions of funds to something that is not
demanded by the beneficiaries? And to deviate from Solow (and his
follower)? I understand that you don=E2=80=99t really mean that, only that =
more
thoughts should go into how to =E2=80=9Callocate=E2=80=9D resources between=
:



1.     Investment =E2=80=93 combination of =E2=80=9Crole-out of infrastruct=
ure=E2=80=9D and
=E2=80=9Ctake-up=E2=80=9D (capacities influenced by training, education, re=
search etc.).

2.     Consider =E2=80=9CCui bono=E2=80=9D (who benefits) of the action. Wh=
en I did a
course in policy science in the 70s we were recommended to consider Cui
Bono. Today I struggle how to interpret that recommendation. Should we
propose not to give 90% of population in rural Sweden broadband just
because 10% may never get it? Should =E2=80=9Cequal communication facilitie=
s=E2=80=9D be
provided on village, regional, national or global level? In that case, why
do we not consider the equality issues when we build roads as not all
citizens are able to use the road and some citizens might not use the road
to go to church on Sunday but to=E2=80=A6etc.



Your work is really interesting. I=C2=B4m sorry I don=E2=80=99t have the ti=
me for more
conclusive feedback.



Best regards,



Barbro Fransson

Hello all,



We have put together a short paper on the ethicality of Internet
initiatives for developing regions. It will be presented at the workshop on
Ethics in Networked Systems Research in London later in the summer. We
wanted to share it with you and invite any feedback.



Abstract: There has been a long standing tradition amongst developed
nations of influencing, both directly and indirectly, the activities of
developing economies. Behind this is one of a range of aims:
building/improving living standards, bettering the social status of
recipient communities, etc. In some cases, this has resulted in prosperous
relations, yet often this has been seen as the exploitation of a power
position or a veneer for other activities (e.g. to tap into new emerging
markets). In this paper, we explore whether initiatives to improve Internet
connectivity in developing regions are always ethical. We draw a list of
issues that would aid in formulating Internet initiatives that are ethical,
effective, and sustainable.
