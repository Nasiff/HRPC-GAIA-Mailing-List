Hello Chintan, Nishanth and Prof Wolisz,

  Thanks for your input.

I agree with you on these points.

It is extremely important to understand the user/stakeholder
requirements before we embark on proposing architectural solutions.

One important point that stems out as possible action item/s (based on
the several rounds of discussions I had with Dirk Trossen for more
than a year now) would be to define a socio-economic evaluation
framework or a set of frameworks. This will create the understanding
regarding the role and inter-play of the various stakeholders for
digital inclusion ranging from service providers, manufacturers, ISPs,
regulators, government, non-government and end users whom will be
crucial for understanding the viability of the architectural solutions
that are proposed via GAIA. Through GAIA we should gather the diverse
stakeholder interactions and requirements and the knowledge which will
feed into the socio-economic evaluation framework. This allows for
defining causality models of the inter-play of the various
stakeholders. These models can then be parameterized with equations
allowing for quantitatively evaluating the likelihood for particular
socio-economic outcomes stemming from a particular architectural
design.  This will help us identify the viability of any proposed
architecture in fulfilling stakeholder requirements and identifying
any tussles around it.

There has been already work around this via the EU PSIRP/PURSUIT
projects through Dirk, Karen Sollins and others, and probably this is
a good time to build on such existing work?

But yes I am happy with this text:
"1) to create increased visibility and interest among the wider
community on the challenges and opportunities in enabling global
Internet access, in terms of both technology and its adoption;"

Regards

I have done the revised text here:
https://trac.tools.ietf.org/group/irtf/trac/wiki/gaia

Any more thoughts?

one that simply improves engineering efficiency (most of the engineering ef=

I'm not completely comfortable with this text:

"We need to create a regulatory space for new business models and =
wireless technologies that also requires innovation."

Who is the 'we' in this sentence? If I reword as follows, I think it =
says what we want to say in a clearer fashion:

"There is a need for innovative regulation and reformed public policy to =
enable new business models and wireless technologies to flourish."

Hi Arjuna,

sorry for coming in so late in this discussion...

I had a look over the current version and I think that, given the 
inherent human-centred focus of the topic, the current description and 
aims talk very little (or not enough :-) ) of exploring the various 
social aspects related to it.
Given the impact social aspects (such as different human needs, 
aspirations and expectations) have both on creating solutions and on 
achieving success and retention, I think they should be elevated on a 
similar level with technology and policy.
What do you think?

Best,
Dana

Dana,

That's an excellent suggestion. While the current text is rather generic =
in terms of adoption, the discussion so far has indeed focused much on =
economic aspects. One option is to keep the text generic but open the =
discussions more to the points you made.

However, we could also think to be a bit more specific in some of the =
text of the charter (starting with the 4th paragraph and ruthlessly =
using some of your own statements):
"There are policy and research challenges at the level of social =
science, economics and technology to the realisation of a future =
Internet capability that will offer appropriate access to all parts of =
society. There can be no single uniform solution that embraces all types =
of user and all locations, given the impact that social aspects (such as =
different human needs and aspirations) have on building technological =
solutions. It is important to emphasize that there also is room for =
innovation and experimentation in policy. The major obstacles to more =
persistent and affordable access in sub-Saharan Africa, parts of Asia, =
the Middle East, and other regions are not technological but regulatory. =
There is a need for innovative regulation and reformed public policy to =
enable new business models and wireless technologies to flourish. =
Moreover, the social science dimension of an universal Internet must not =
be forgotten, capturing the impact of human values on the design =
decisions of underlying solutions on the one hand and the impact of the =
Internet on the human value network on the other hand. =20

The Global Access to the Internet for All (GAIA) is an IRTF initiative =
that aims

(1) to create increased visibility and interest among the wider =
community on the challenges and opportunities in enabling global =
Internet access, in terms of technology as well as the social and =
economic drivers for its adoption;"

Best,

Dirk

Hello Arjuna,

catching up late on these e-mails...

Energy-efficiency is indeed highly relevant. Would vote for having it as 
a number to address.

Hello Arjuna,

some potential changes by COPELABS/me/Paulo, in case you feel they make 
sense. IMO the divide we see is a product also of Internet architectural 
design. The structure and core of the Internet has been designed just 
considering a technological approach. To make it evolve and to bring it 
closer to society (and hence, to generate new products, and a better 
societal impact) future design needs to consider at least:

i) neutrality of access. This relates with the economical side of 
technology, and incentives for all players (in particular for access 
providers) to invest on open business models. However, there is some 
overlap to other groups.

ii) human-centric aspects. Required to make the Internet more intuitive 
(not just applications, for instance, connectivity sharing); social 
structures dynamics capable of generating knowledge (better social 
capital) and not just capable of generating economical evenue. This goes 
also in the line of what Dana mentioned.

iii) energy-efficiency. As stated by someone (Mark, I believe), 
energy-efficiency is a must. Opportunistic networking, as well as 
user-centric networking require new design approaches, even for 
protocols. energy should be seen as a QoS aspect. Routing metrics, 
energy-aware, can improve the network robustness and longevity. This 
aspect is also being worked upon in ROLL, but with a specific intention: 
routing in low power networks. However, any opportunistic approach, as 
well as any multihop approach should already be designed having this 
aspect in mind.

iv) technology adoption. GAIA should focus on incentive models that can 
be used in these networks. By experience this is one of the most 
relevant aspects to tackle in concerns with adoption of open models. 
Incentives may be economical; technological; social.

The charter, as it stands, is way too generic. We cannot clearly state 
the expected impact; relation with prior work; relation with future 
work. By working something in the line of the items I send you, the 
charter will bcome more objective.

We can assist in concrete writing, if you need. Do not want to add 
entropy though :)

Thinking a little on the issue of power and focus, maybe a way to frame =
the problem is this: I think that work to reduce power should be in =
scope (because OPEX & CAPEX is invariably directly related to power =
demand), but how that power is generated or distributed is orthogonal =
and out of scope.=20

In other words, if someone comes up with an way to deliver the same N =
mbps at much less power, that's a win and we should be interested.  If =
someone says they can produce or distribute power more efficiently, we =
should applaud them but not consider that GAIA related.

+1.

I strongly agree with Jim. I think work on energy efficient comms is
important and in scope of GAIA, but how energy is produced and
supplied are out of scope.

What is important to understand, is GAIA is about understanding the
various factors that are obstacles for wider adoption of the Internet
and using this forum to promote, collaborate, architect, document and
disseminate "networking" solutions that address those challenges and
its successful adoption.

Hello Rute,
  Thanks for your thoughts.

In principle, I agree with your thoughts and kind of documented some
of this here: http://www.internetsociety.org/publications/ietf-journal-july-2014/researching-global-access-internet-for-all-gaia

However for the charter, based on the past discussions, I am keen to
keep it more general and wide open for the following reasons:

1/ There is no single or uniform solution to the problem GAIA tackles.

2/I dont see GAIA having a finite number of outcomes: we are not going
to propose one single protocol X or architecture Y to solve GAIA's
problems since the problem space varies. One cannot be applied to the
other.

3/GAIA has relevance to all of the IETF and IRTF work: I can see how
network coding can be used for information diffusion, ICN and DTN as
useful alternate architectures, TCPM, TSVWG on transport layer stuff
etc..So we cannot list what is the relation with prior or future work
because GAIA encompasses a problem space where all of these work at
the IETF and IRTF are directly related and has a direct effect.

That is the exact reason why I said to Jim Forster that its hard to
have KPIs here, since the goal of GAIA is to foster research in this
area. And if successful collaborations happen, if we get wider
participation, if we can raise awareness within the wider community,
if successful adoptions happen because of GAIA, then GAIA is
successful - not by publishing a protocol X as a experiment RFC. This
is the difference I see between GAIA and the other groups. I think our
immediate aim should be to raise more awareness around the problem
space we are tackling within the wider community and encourage more
participation and collaboration. That is the exact reason why I am
organising these workshops and over the next year we have to have some
better ways of doing this rather than just having presentations (we
should have breakout groups, more demos etc).


What I would like to know is - is there any part of the current
charter text that limits what you want to do or what you think should
be done that is of relevance to GAIA and would be beneficial to the
goals of GAIA. If thats the case, then we need to definitely
change/add?

Regards

I agree. There are some works (scientific papers) proposing measures and 
algorithms to deliver the same rates with less power. Approaches range 
from other-than-shortest-path to encoding aspects (e.g. network coding). 
In a protocolar level, there is also some work where metrics assist in 
reducing the energy consumption to deliver the same data. This is an 
essential aspect to consider as we are speaking of dynamic environments; 
intermittent connectivity; progressive design.

Hello Arjuna,
What I would like to know is - is there any part of the current charter 
text that limits what you want to do or what you think should be done 
that is of relevance to GAIA and would be beneficial to the goals of 
GAIA. If thats the case, then we need to definitely change/add?

As explained, the interest that we see in GAIA are the 4 points provided 
earlier. Energy-efficiency; human-centricity; technology adoption; 
neutrality of access. Of these, only neutrality of access is clearly 
covered.

Just my 2cents.

Rute

a quick note on IRTF RG charters vs. IETF WG charters.

RG charters serve mostly as a statement of interest in a particular =
research area. If some researcher out there comes across the group's =
charter page and asks "is this group for me?", reading the charter =
should give them an answer to that question. So RG charters are usually =
worded to be broadly understandable, and invite people to participate =
and share their research and experiences. RG charters typically never =
change after an RG gets started, because they should be broad enough to =
encompass lots of topics a RG may choose to investigate during its =
lifetime.

On the other hand, IETF WGs do standardization in very narrow technical =
areas, and their charters are therefore very carefully worded to define =
the exact little technical corner that a WG is supposed to be active in, =
and go into a lot of detail about what exactly a WG is supposed to =
deliver and when. Because they are so specific, frequent recharters are =
needed.

There is a bit more about this in Section 2.6 of =
http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-dawkins-irtf-newrg-05, which is in =
general a good (and quick) read.

Lars

PS: I'm wondering if using a different word than "charter" would drive =
home the point that IRTF RG charters serve a very different purpose than =
IETF WG charters.

Hello Lars,

I believe we are all familiarized with what is the purpose of the IETF 
and of the IRTF. :), the wording is fine there.

In terms of scientific output, to us, our interests are clear, and the 
charter, as it is written down, seems to go more into one direction...

Rute

If some researcher out there comes across the group's charter page and asks "is this group for me?", reading the charter should give them an answer to that question. So RG charters are usually worded to be broadly understandable, and invite people to participate and share their research and experiences. RG charters typically never change after an RG gets started, because they should be broad enough to encompass lots of topics a RG may choose to investigate during its lifetime.

All,
  The final participants list is here: http://doodle.com/kq4nxewwsytwvva6

If you are not planning to attend the workshop, could you please let
me know immediately.

The final agenda is here: https://sites.google.com/site/irtfgaia/home/gaia-2

It will be great if you can email me your presentations by Friday
17th, so that I can upload them prior to the workshop.

Also, there is no plan for any formal dinner for Monday evening, but I
am planning to book a floor in the nearby pub from 5pm onwards thats
within walking distance (http://thecastleinncambridge.com/)  for us to
socialise/have dinner etc. So incase anyone who wishes to not attend,
please let me too - so that I have the right numbers for reserving the
tables. Thanks.

Finally thanks to Mat Ford from the ISOC for helping me with the
funding to host you all and Jane Butler for providing the "Wireless
Networking in the Developing World" book as a compliment for everyone
who is attending the workshop.

Regards
Arjuna

Arjuna,

I'm going to push back some on this:

> That is the exact reason why I said to Jim Forster that its hard to
> have KPIs here, since the goal of GAIA is to foster research in this
> area.=20

Sure, it's not easy, but if we want the research to have a good effect, =
it must target worthy topics.  The goals as outlined in the charter are, =
frankly, somewhat pedestrian.  Abbreviating drastically, they are:

> (1) to create increased visibility...on the challenges and =
opportunities in enabling global Internet access..
>=20
> (2) to create a shared vision among... practitioners, researchers...
>=20
> (3) to articulate and foster collaboration...
>=20
> (4) to document and share deployment experiences...
>=20
> (5) to develop a longer term perspective on the impact...This could =
include recommendations to protocol designers and architects.

These goals are too easily met and even when met could have no =
meaningful impact on Internet Access.  Certainly that's the history: =
lots and lots of groups and meetings have had roughly the same goals, =
and yet here we are, with another group starting again at the same place =
and likely to end at the same place.

What is possibly different about this group is the caliber of the =
researchers.  I believe this group could make a huge difference if it =
took on an additional goal:

> (6) Document the costs of existing Internet Access, the breakdown of =
those costs (energy, people, licenses, upstream bandwidth, equipment..), =
and outline a path to achieve a 10x reduction in Internet Access costs =
especially in geographies and populations with low penetration.

I won't be at the Oct 20 meeting, as I'll be in India for an annual =
internal strategic review of AirJaldi, but I urge people to discuss this =
last item and consider some form of it as an additional goal.  =20

If we inspire people to take on the goal of 10x cost reduction, and we =
all persevere toward that goal, then we will make a huge difference in =
the world.


Jim

Hello Jim,
I understand and if this goal is achievable via GAIA that's great. But I am
hoping members like you would be able dlead/drive the work within GAIA to
reach that goal and I would be more than happy to help organise. Probably
we can discuss this at ACM DEV.

I am really happy to add it if others have no objections.

All, any issues with the text Jim Forster has provided?

"(6) Document the costs of existing Internet Access, the breakdown of those
costs (energy, people, licenses, upstream bandwidth, equipment..), and
outline a path to achieve a 10x reduction in Internet Access costs
especially in geographies and populations with low penetration."

Thanks Jim.

Regards
Arjuna

Hi all,
I am very pleased with Jim's text, Focusing in a specific goal and
mentioning the path that could be pursued to achieve it is the way to go.

Best,

I don't want to prolong the debate unnecessarily and I am ok with having
this in the charter.  However, having been down this road a few times, I
would like to point out that it is a huge undertaking.  Probably the best
source on affordability of access is done by ResearchICTAfrica (RIA) and
their sister networks LirneAsia (south and east asia) and DIRSI (latin
america).  While I was at IDRC, we put millions and millions of well-spent
dollars into those networks and still we are only scratching the surface.

When Google first came to Africa, they funded a study into "Africa Internet
Pricing, Market Share, Fiber, Competition".  I think I still have the
Google spreadsheet somewhere.   They packed in after realising the scope of
what they were taking on.

Internet.org hired McKinsey to research and publish (last week) Offline and
Falling Behind -  http://www.internet.org/press/offline-and-falling-behind
which is another attempt to quantify the situation.

My question would be, what are we bringing to the table that is new?  Are
there ways that we can collaborate more closely with others already engaged
in this work to build on their results.

If GAIA is serious about this and unless someone is sitting on a pot of
gold somewhere, it might make sense to perhaps choose a couple of countries
to do a deep dive on the access ecosystem or pick some aspect like energy
or spectrum fees and try to go broad on that.

My 2cs

Regards... Steve

You're right; it's a lot of work, so it's great that much has done =
already.  We shouldn't re-do that work, but rather use it to inform the =
research.  Let's look at the Internet.org/McKinsey study you mention, =
and any other good ones that you know of from past work.

The charter says "it is simply not cost effective for Internet Service =
Providers (ISPs) to install the required infrastructure", without any =
detail. As an engineer I need to measure before I can optimize. Ideally =
we can estimate the cost contribution several major areas (equipment, =
people, licenses & taxes, upstream bandwidth, energy).  Right now I =
don't think have a good handle on what those are.   Of course these will =
be rough estimates, but without them any effort carries an implicit and =
untested assumption that it can make a difference.

Hello Steve, Jim,

  thanks for your thoughts -

1/ What I am interested to know is are we aiming to "conduct research"
to understand the costs, then "document it" and then "define a
pathway" of how to reduce costs by a factor of 10?

If we are to do the above, then as Steve mentions, we need to take a
couple of countries as a case study and work on them. But this
requires mobilising the necessary collaborations with government, NGOs
and other relevant stakeholders which itself is a huge undertaking and
we need the help of organisations like A4AI (cc-ing Kojo Boakye) or
Internet.org to achieve this.

2/ Or are we going to "demonstrate" 1/ has actually lead to a cost
reduction of a factor of 10? I dont think that's what Jim meant - but
still trying to understand.

Ironically, we are hosting this Dagstuhl seminar in November where we
are having people like Henning Schulzrinne (CTO of the FCC) coming in
- but it would have been great if some of you had joined us to take
these discussions forward - Dagstuhl would have been a great place to
start this off..

Regards

I'd be quite interested in the results and trends - but I worry about the
"document" goal and possible suggestion that a long- standing permanent
record (aka an RFC) is appropriate to capture such a survey. I think
documenting this in RFC series doesn't sound helpful.

I'd expect a survey to be helpful for a limited period of time. Is a

 The FCC is hosting an Open Internet Roundtable October 7, 9:30 AM - 1:00
PM EDT. It's in DC but will be webcasted as well @ http://www.fcc.gov/live

"The roundtable discussions will focus on public policy considerations and
how they should be addressed to protect and promote Internet openness in
both the fixed and mobile markets; the technological considerations
involved in protecting the open Internet; how the competitive landscape and
the economics of providing broadband and online services affects Internet
openness; how the Commission can effectively enforce the current and
proposed open Internet requirements; and the various legal theories
underlying possible Commission actions in this area."

If you can't view the live webcast it should be archived once it's done @
http://www.fcc.gov/events/past

More info at http://www.fcc.gov/events/open-internet-roundtable-law I also
pasted it below.

* October 7, 2014, 9:30 AM - 1:00 PM EDT *
* Commission Meeting Room, 445 12th Street SW, Washington, DC * *Internet
Openness and the Law*

In the *2014 Open Internet NPRM
<http://www.fcc.gov/document/protecting-and-promoting-open-internet-nprm>*,
the Commission began the process of closing the gap created by the Verizon
decision, which left no legally enforceable rules for the Commission to
prevent broadband providers from acting to limit Internet openness. The *20=
14
Open Internet NPRM
<http://www.fcc.gov/document/protecting-and-promoting-open-internet-nprm>*
sought broad public comment on how the Commission should ensure that the
Internet remains open, and proposed new rules and enhancements to current
rules.

To further develop our understanding of the issues, the Commission is
hosting a series
<http://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-schedules-series-open-internet-roundtable-=
discussions>
of staff-led Open Internet Roundtable Discussions that are free and open to
the public. The Open Internet Roundtable Discussions provide an opportunity
for the Commission staff and interested parties to further examine the
actions the Commission should take for its goal of determining the best
approach to protecting and promoting Internet openness.

The roundtable discussions will focus on public policy considerations and
how they should be addressed to protect and promote Internet openness in
both the fixed and mobile markets; the technological considerations
involved in protecting the open Internet; how the competitive landscape and
the economics of providing broadband and online services affects Internet
openness; how the Commission can effectively enforce the current and
proposed open Internet requirements; and the various legal theories
underlying possible Commission actions in this area.

*Attendance and Participation:* The roundtables will be free and open to
the public, and the FCC also will stream them live at
http://www.fcc.gov/live. The location of the roundtables will be the
Commission Meeting Room (TW-C305), 445 12th Street, S.W., Washington, D.C.,
20554. The FCC will make available an overflow room for those in-person
attendees who cannot be accommodated in the Commission Meeting Room. We
advise persons planning to attend the roundtables in person to leave
sufficient time to enter through building security.

The FCC encourages members of the public to submit suggested questions in
advance and during the roundtables by email to roundtables@fcc.gov or on
Twitter using the hashtag #FCCRoundtables
<https://twitter.com/search?f=3Drealtime&q=3D%23FCCRoundtables&src=3Dtypd>.
Please note that by submitting a question, you will be making a filing in
an official FCC proceeding. All information submitted, including names,
addresses, and other personal information contained in the message, may be
publicly available online.

Reasonable accommodations for people with disabilities are available upon
request. The request should include a detailed description of the
accommodation needed and contact information. We ask that requests for
accommodations be made as soon as possible in order to allow the agency to
satisfy such requests whenever possible. Send an email to fcc504@fcc.gov or
call the Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau at 202-418-0530 (voice),
202-418-0432 (TTY).

Hi all,
=20
I have just uploaded a new version of the =E2=80=9Cmanyfolks=E2=80=9D =
draft. Its new title is =E2=80=9CAlternative Network Deployments. =
Taxonomy and characterization=E2=80=9D, so it is not only about =
Community Networks, but it also includes other approaches. We hope you =
like it!
http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks/ =

=20
We have used a lot of ideas from the discussion in the list: see this =
thread:
http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/gaia/current/msg00187.html=20
=20
You may perhaps find some sentences from yourselves, since there were =
lots of interesting ideas in the posted messages. So thank you very =
much!
=20
And of course, don=E2=80=99t forget that this is just a draft. Our idea =
is that you can read it, and it can be discussed in the Workshop in =
Cambridge, in two weeks.
=20
=20
This is the new abstract, which summarizes the new =
=E2=80=9Cscope=E2=80=9D of the document:
=20
This document presents a taxonomy of "alternative network
deployments", and a set of definitions and shared characteristics.
This term includes a set of network models emerged in the last
decades with the aim of bringing Internet connectivity to people,
following topological, architectural and business models different
from the so-called "traditional" ones, where a company deploys the
infrastructure connecting the households of the users, who pay for
it.
=20
Several initiatives throughout the World have built large scale
networks that use wireless technologies (including long distance) due
to the reduced cost of using the unlicensed spectrum. Others rely on
wired technologies. Some of these networks are self-organized and
decentralized, other ones are based on sharing wireless resources of
the users. The emergence of these networks can be motivated by
different causes: Sometimes the reluctance, or the impossibility, of
network operators to provide wired and cellular infrastructures to
rural/remote areas. In these cases, the networks have self
sustainable business models that provide more localised communication
services as well as providing Internet backhaul support through
peering agreements with traditional network operators. Some other
times, they are built as a complement and an alternative to
commercial Internet access provided by "traditional" network
operators.
=20
The classification considers different existing network models as
e.g., community networks, open wireless services, user-extensible
services, traditional local ISPs, new global ISPs, etc. Different
criteria are used in order to build a classification as e.g., the
ownership of the equipment, the way the network is organized, the
participatory model, the extensibility, if they are driven by a
community, a company or a local (public or private) stakeholder, etc.
=20
According to the developed taxonomy, a characterization of each kind
of network is presented, in terms of network characteristics related
to architecture, organization, etc.
=20
=20
=20
Best regards and thank you,
=20
Jose

All,
  Could you please read the revised charter and let me know if this is
ok, so that we can proceed with the chartering process.

Jim - I have revised your text slightly as follows:
(5) to document the costs of existing Internet Access, the breakdown
of those costs (energy, manpower, licenses, bandwidth, infrastructure,
transit, peering), and outline a path to achieve a 10x reduction in
Internet Access costs especially in geographies and populations with
low penetration.

If anyone wants to propose any changes, please do so. I would like to
propose a final deadline of Friday 10th to finalise the final charter
edits.

Thanks
Arjuna

All,

The tentative agenda for the third GAIA workshop is now online
(waiting for a few titles from the speakers).
https://sites.google.com/site/irtfgaia/home/3rd-gaia-meeting

Currently bookings are opened on discounted rates at the Hilton San
Jose hotel, California which would be the venue of the workshop + DEV
(http://acmdev.org/venue/).

Accommodation can be booked online or over the phone. We have blocked
a limited set of rooms at Hilton San Jose for December 4th and 5th
nights at the discounted rate of $139 + tax per night. Use the group
code DEV and refer to the ACM DEV-5 conference to avail the special
discount.

 The discounted rates are guaranteed only until November 5, 2014, or
until the blocked rooms are sold out, whichever is earlier. Hence, we
request DEV/GAIA attendees to make the hotel reservations at the
earliest. Please contact the hotel directly for any booking/discounted
rate related questions (for example, for additional nights
before/after).

Regards
Arjuna

All,
  Just a reminder - if anyone has any comments/suggestions for the
GAIA charter text, please let me know by today. We will be confirming
the charter text end of today and I will request Lars to start the
chartering process with the IAB. Thanks

I read it. Its plenty good enough. Thanks for all the effort on
the real work and the (smallish:-) bureaucracy.

I have one question but am fine if that's not answered now or if
answering it is considered as part of the work. I could also maybe
buy an argument that calling this out might be counter-productive
but nonetheless want to ask the question.

The charter mentions "innovative regulation" but doesn't anywhere
mention censorship as an anti-goal. I believe that censorship is a
real issue in many of the environments to be considered here, and
deploying censored networks in clever ways would be considered by
some as a fine example of innovative regulation. I also believe
that censorship of Internet content by service providers is a
bad idea in general (though made more complex by e.g. anti-spam
mechanisms) and would be happier if the GAIA RG had as a goal
that the kind of access for which it aims is unfettered access.

So my question is: should GAIA be explicit that investigation
of the impacts of and methods for routing around censorship are
in scope and that censorship is an anti-goal? Or perhaps put
more positively that "access to the Internet" means unfettered
access to all of the Internet?

Cheers,
S.

Hello Stephen,
  Thanks for this.

I thought about censorship but then didnt really add it to the
charter. If the group want to look into censorship, then its great.

Would you prefer this text for point (3):
"(3) to articulate and foster collaboration among them to address the
diverse Internet access and architectural challenges (including
security, privacy, censorship and energy efficiency);"

Regards

&gt; I read it. Its plenty good enough. Thanks for all the effort on<br>
&gt; the real work and the (smallish:-) bureaucracy.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I have one question but am fine if that&#39;s not answered now or if<b=
r>
&gt; answering it is considered as part of the work. I could also maybe<br>
&gt; buy an argument that calling this out might be counter-productive<br>
&gt; but nonetheless want to ask the question.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; The charter mentions &quot;innovative regulation&quot; but doesn&#39;t=
 anywhere<br>
&gt; mention censorship as an anti-goal. I believe that censorship is a<br>
&gt; real issue in many of the environments to be considered here, and<br>
&gt; deploying censored networks in clever ways would be considered by<br>
&gt; some as a fine example of innovative regulation. I also believe<br>
&gt; that censorship of Internet content by service providers is a<br>
&gt; bad idea in general (though made more complex by e.g. anti-spam<br>
&gt; mechanisms) and would be happier if the GAIA RG had as a goal<br>
&gt; that the kind of access for which it aims is unfettered access.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; So my question is: should GAIA be explicit that investigation<br>
&gt; of the impacts of and methods for routing around censorship are<br>
&gt; in scope and that censorship is an anti-goal? Or perhaps put<br>
&gt; more positively that &quot;access to the Internet&quot; means unfetter=
ed<br>
&gt; access to all of the Internet?<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; groups and meetings have had roughly the same goals, a=
nd yet here we are,<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with another group starting again at the same place an=
d likely to end at the<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; same place.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What is possibly different about this group is the cal=
iber of the<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; researchers.=C2=A0 I believe this group could make a h=
uge difference if it took<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on an additional goal:<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (6) Document the costs of existing Internet Access=
, the breakdown of<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; those costs (energy, people, licenses, upstream ba=
ndwidth, equipment..), and<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; outline a path to achieve a 10x reduction in Inter=
net Access costs<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; especially in geographies and populations with low=
 penetration.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I won&#39;t be at the Oct 20 meeting, as I&#39;ll be i=
n India for an annual<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; internal strategic review of AirJaldi, but I urge peop=
le to discuss this<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; last item and consider some form of it as an additiona=
l goal.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If we inspire people to take on the goal of 10x cost r=
eduction, and we all<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; persevere toward that goal, then we will make a huge d=
ifference in the<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; world.<br>

I've no objection to such a change. It's a little better all right.

Much better might be to insert somewhere words to the effect that
when you say "access to the Internet" you mean "unfettered access
to all of the Internet to the extent feasible." (I don't care
which words where.)

Note that that is stated as a goal, I do not mean that nothing should
be done that doesn't fully meet that goal - and for example, its for
sure that some networks would have to be deployed in places with
censorship, and while that's not the best thing, it's a reality that
has to be dealt with. But adopting this goal does mean that any
architecture that needlessly adds a censor (or the opportunity for
one) into all communications would be called out as deficient.

Thanks Stephen.

I have added unfettered here:
"There are policy and research challenges at the level of social
science, economics and technology to the realisation of a future
Internet capability that will offer appropriate and unfettered access
to all parts of society."

Is this ok?

...just another memo for the future work, about the semantics of the 
term "access".

The "access" should comprise the idea that user could be 
reached/reachable from the Internet through a (purely routed) public IP, 
obtained with the access. The "Reachability" should be available in 
principle and at least as an option (at a small fraction of the basic 
cost for the basic access).

"Reachability" - as "reciprocal" (bi-directional: not necessarily 
symmetric) access - enforces the relation of the "Global Access to the 
Internet for All" with the citizenship rights. Conversely, an 
"unreachable" Internet Access appears as a condition of inferiority, 
that constricts the user to delegate and entrust his "Internet 
existence" to others (...peering techniques, e.g skype, remain a 
palliative form of delegation).

Cheers,
Francesco

All,
  There were some requests to change the panel session which is going
to strike a very interesting debate (chaired by Joerg Ott and an
exciting panel), since some of you were leaving slightly earlier on
Tuesday.

So I have revised the agenda accordingly here:
https://sites.google.com/site/irtfgaia/home/gaia-2

Hope this is ok with the attendees and the other speakers.
Regards
Arjuna

To those who are attending the workshop -

there are two things I would like to let you know in advance -

1/ The doors to the William Gates Building open only at 8:30 am.

2/ Currently the west cambridge site is undergoing a major revamp and
hence there are several roadworks going on in parallel at the
Madingley Road. There is heavy traffic during the morning peak hour
and it would take an additional 30 mins. So please consider this for
your to and fro journey.

Regards
Arjuna

Hi, If you know any SME interested in experiments using Community-Lab
or any other Fed4FIRE testbed =E2=80=A6

Community-Lab is part of the Fed4FIRE federated testbeds. As part of
that there=E2=80=99s a call to fund experiments from SME (typically Europea=
n
but other countries may apply). See below. You can get up to 25,000 =E2=82=
=AC
with a quite lightweight application.

Deadline: October 30.

More details: http://confine-project.eu/2014/10/20/call-to-fund-experiments=

*DIY broadband pioneers reaching out to remote areas of Britain*

By Emma De Vita

[image: Picture by Jon Super for The Financial Times newspaper. Pic for
Annabel Cook Picture re story about the lengths business people have gone
to to mitigate poor broadband connection, be that driving to the pub to use
its fast broadband or picking up a spade to install fibre optic cables
themselves. John is a video producer and film maker who became involved
with the B4RN community action group and joined the rest of his village to
dig trenches to lay fibre optic cable after BT told them they weren't going
to do it. Pic shows shows John Hamlett with a team 'blowing', cables by the
village of Borwick near Kirby Lonsdale, England, Wednesday Oct. 1, 2014.

The acrobatic feats some UK businesses perform to get a decent internet
speed can provoke a sense of wonder. It might be a desperate dash to upload
content in a local pub that has superfast broadband, juggling three types
of technology to make a feeble connection to the cloud, or even swapping a
laptop for a spade to help lay fibre optic cable.

To those in less developed countries, these might be trivial concerns. The
UK average internet connection speed of 11.1 mbps ranks 16th globally
<http://www.akamai.com/dl/whitepapers/akamai-soti-a4-q214.pdf?campaign_id=
=3DF-MC-22494&curl=3D/dl/whitepapers/akamai-soti-a4-q214.pdf&solcheck=3D1&W=
T.mc_id=3Dsoti_Q214&>,
according to Akamai. But for British businesses experiencing data transfers
that fall well short of these norms, it can be a life-threatening issue
that requires workarounds that are both ingenious and dispiriting at the
same time.

*The pub as the broadband hub*
John Readman is co-founder of cycling tour business Ride25
<http://www.ride25.com/>, and works from his village home in Catterton,
North Yorkshire. =E2=80=9CI get a faster internet connection up a mountain =
in the
Swiss Alps than I do here,=E2=80=9D he complains. A customer of BT, the for=
mer UK
telephone monopoly, his typical upload speed is 0.3 mbps =E2=80=93 problema=
tic for
an online business with a visual product to sell. =E2=80=9CI need to consta=
ntly
upload photos and videos of cycling trips to the website.=E2=80=9D

He usually sets a video to upload overnight when bandwidth is better but
more often than not he will have to drive to his local pub to upload files.
=E2=80=9CIt does have its upside as you can get a sneaky pint in but intern=
et
businesses should be run from anywhere and the infrastructure should be
there.=E2=80=9D BT has refused to install fibre optic broadband, telling Mr=
 Readman
his house is too remote.

*The service juggler*
Mark Maclure, founder and MD of marketing communications agency Stream Comm=
s
<http://www.streamcomms.com/>, used to perform his own broadband
gymnastics. Based in a rural business park in Buckinghamshire, Mr Maclure
until last month managed three different broadband technologies after BT
told him a fibre optic connection was not feasible. =E2=80=9CWe are an agen=
cy that
builds and runs web apps for clients globally, and we rely on broadband for
our cloud-based working. The broadband issue is the biggest threat to our
business,=E2=80=9D he explains.

To mitigate a poor service, he had been forced to use a BT ADSL line, EE
mobile WiFi and a wireless Village Networks connection =E2=80=93 though he =
has just
swapped this threesome for one fibre optic line bought by the business
park=E2=80=99s landlord.

=E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s much better now we are getting faster broadband speed=
s. Life is
becoming much more productive,=E2=80=9D Mr Maclure says with relief. =E2=80=
=9CThe amount of
money it has cost us to get a decent broadband speed and the lost people
days trying to get a connection is not something I would like to spend too
much time thinking about.=E2=80=9D


*Dig for downloads*
Frustration has forced an increasing number of communities to take matters
into their own hands and simply install the fibre optic infrastructure
themselves. =E2=80=9CIf we can do it then anyone can do it,=E2=80=9D says C=
hris Conder, a
farmer=E2=80=99s wife and founding member of Lancashire-based community act=
ion
group B4RN <http://b4rn.org.uk/>. She speaks, spade in hand, from a
windswept field alongside nine colleagues, who are there to fix a network
blockage. =E2=80=9CIt is about the community doing it for the community,=E2=
=80=9D she adds.

B4RN draws on the help of 400 volunteers, many of whom are retired farmers,
to install 1,000 mbps fibre optic broadband. Since 2012, B4RN has networked
20 remote villages, using locals to dig the trenches. They buy the
materials direct from Scottish supplier Emtelle. A non-profit organisation,
B4RN offers shares to diggers and landowners who in return receive a direct
fibre connection. Users pay =C2=A330 a month for the service, which also
includes free phone lines.

John Hamlett, a video producer based in Gressingham, was struggling with
his upload speeds and eagerly watched B4RN=E2=80=99s rollout. =E2=80=9CI kn=
ew someone in a
village nearby who had B4RN and I would give them a ring to use their
broadband. Something I had tried uploading over 12 hours uploaded in six
minutes there.=E2=80=9D Mr Hamlett became his village broadband champion,
organising the community to raise the =C2=A330,000 needed for materials to =
bring
fibre optic broadband to 70 households.

Mr Hamlett is one of the 40 volunteer diggers who help across the whole
network, maintaining the cables already installed and bringing it to other
villages. =E2=80=9CIt has created a lot of good community spirit. People co=
me along
with cake to say =E2=80=98thanks for networking my house=E2=80=99.=E2=80=9D=
 He has even launched a
new online business, WeUpload, to help others with poor broadband to upload
their files using his B4RN connection.


*The co-op that roared*
Another community action group, Cybermoor
<http://www.cybermoor.org/cybermoor/cybermoor>, launched in 2001 in Alston,
Cumbria, claims to be the first broadband co-operative in England. It laid
its first cables in 2009 but has since outgrown its amateur roots to become
a serious broadband supplier, used by companies such as mailroom supplier
Totalpost Services. Hugo Raddon, IT manager at Totalpost=E2=80=99s Alston
headquarters, says the service connected its three offices across the UK.
=E2=80=9CThere=E2=80=99s no way we could have done that without Cybermoor,=
=E2=80=9D he says.

Hooking up a remote farm that can cope with unexpected outages is one thing
but connecting a large business that needs 24/7 support is another. =E2=80=
=9CThe
plan for Cybermoor Networks is to stay ahead of the game in terms of
bandwidth and infrastructure, which has been quite a challenge over the
years for a small co-operative based in a remote area,=E2=80=9D says Daniel=
 Heery,
Cybermoor Network=E2=80=99s project manager.

The solution has been to give the running of the network to a private
company, Briskona, while the community co-operative retains ownership of
the fibre optic network itself. =E2=80=9CWe handed over the operations to t=
hem
earlier this year because it was getting too complicated. It=E2=80=99s easi=
er for
the community to own the pipes and another company to operate the
day-to-day running of it,=E2=80=9D says Mr Heery.

*Further reading: London =E2=80=98It starts to feel like the late 1990s=E2=
=80=99*

Businesses in rural communities are not the only ones forced into
performing connection contortions, *writes Emma De Vita*. London businesses
have suffered too =E2=80=93 even near the Silicon Roundabout hub for digita=
l
businesses.

=E2=80=9CLike many companies around the Roundabout, we faced speeds on lega=
cy BT
phone lines that just weren=E2=80=99t up to snuff,=E2=80=9D explains Alex K=
lein, co-founder
of build-your-own computer company Kano. =E2=80=9CBy the time you reach 20 =
people,
it starts to feel like the late 1990s.=E2=80=9D He says a move further east=
 to
Whitechapel solved the problem.

One of London=E2=80=99s so-called =E2=80=9Cnot-spots=E2=80=9D is Rotherhith=
e, where locals are
collaborating to bring about their own solution after BT=E2=80=99s refusal =
to
install fibre. Damian Belson is a founder of the Rotherhithe Broadband Grou=
p
<http://energise16.co.uk/>. =E2=80=9CThere are 12,000 residents here and
three-quarters of them have less than 2 mbps,=E2=80=9D he says. =E2=80=9CI =
work from home a
lot but I have to have a serviced office just so that I can send large
files.=E2=80=9D With 200 businesses in the area, Mr Belson says fibre is cr=
itical.

Though in its early days, the group has garnered the support of 500
residents and estimates the cost of installing fibre at =C2=A33.5m, though =
the
group=E2=80=99s business model is yet to be decided. One possibility is to =
charge
users =C2=A320 a month including line rental, with discounts and free WiFi =
spots
available for those who cannot afford it. =E2=80=9CWe could become a non-pr=
ofit
organisation offering affordable broadband for all,=E2=80=9D says Mr Belson=
.

Hello Steve,
  Great video - very useful..

Interestingly our discussion yesterday at the GAIA workshop focussed
on some of the topics discussed in the video (the slides will be there
by today for all of you to look at)..

One of the issues we discusses yesterday was how unnecessary ads and
trackers (especially from mobile phones with free apps) were consuming
the precious capacity and also wasting energy (with all those
background chatter).

It will be interesting to how facebook and others would try and solve
this problem..

One of the good outcomes thats emerging out of the workshop is we are
trying to identify ways of GAIA can influence design
protocol/algorithm design decisions at the IETF. And by doing this, we
can not only influence the standardization processes but also
influence application designers and service providers to take into
considerations of the requirements or limitations of emerging
regions/deprived communities.

I think it will be great to build a theme for GAIA around this and
appoint a theme leader who could oversee and steer GAIA towards this.

Regards
Arjuna

l-issue-on-community-networks/>

Community networking is an emerging model for the Future Internet where =
communities of citizens build, operate and own open IP-based networks, =
forming a key infrastructure for individual and collective digital =
participation. Although community-based networks often extend or =
complement the coverage of networks of commercial ISPs, they differ in =
several key aspects. There is usually no central authority that is =
responsible for a precise network planning; a community network grows =
organically. Support is decentralized and open, provided by the =
community to the community. The network nodes are often inexpensive =
off-the-shelf equipment and the network elements exhibit a high degree =
of heterogeneity in the hardware, software, and capacity. The entire =
network infrastructure belongs to the users and is shared to build the =
network. The network is very dynamic: the number of nodes may rapidly =
grow and change as new members join the network, or when nodes overload =
or fail. These community networks are usually built with low cost =
point-to-point wireless links organised in mesh networks, with an =
increasing presence of optical fibre links.

In these scenarios, the networking and systems research community has =
the opportunity to contribute with more sustainable, adaptive, scalable, =
integrated, autonomic solutions for those common traits in community =
networks.

This special issue aims to collect publications addressing theoretical =
and practical challenges of community networks and services, including =
multi-disciplinary contributions that provide insights in the =
socio-technical-economic understanding of the community network =
operation and growth.

Topics of Interest

Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following:

Wireless mesh network protocols for community networks
Wireless MAC and routing protocols for heterogeneous community networks
Services and applications in community networks
Cross-layer designs and implementation in community networks
Hybrid community networks with wireless and optical fibre links
Tools for bootstrapping and running community networks
Clouds for community networks
Interoperation of cloud-based community services
Performance modelling and evaluation of community networks and services
Quality of service provisioning
Quality of experience in community networks
Community network security and privacy
Large-scale management and data collection infrastructures
Incentive models for encouraging users and businesses to participate in =
community networks
Socio-technical-economic models for community networks
Community networks research infrastructure
Submission Details

This special issue solicits papers from an open call and extended papers =
selected from the International Workshop on Community Networks and =
Bottom-up-Broadband (CNBuB). http://research.ac.upc.edu/ =
<http://research.ac.upc.edu/>(CNBuB2014, CNBuB2013, CNBuB2012)

The journal submission should extend previously published =
workshop/conference papers considerably (a minimum of 30%) with new =
content. Papers that are essentially the same as the workshop papers =
will be rejected and will not be considered for review.

All received submissions within the scope of this special issue will be =
sent out for blind peer review by three experts in the field and be =
evaluated in regards to the relevance for this special issue, level of =
novelty, depth of contribution, and overall quality. Submitted articles =
must be original, unpublished, and not currently under review by other =
journals. If the paper was preliminarily published at a conference, the =
submitted manuscript must be a substantial extension of the conference =
paper. In this case, authors are also required to explain the =
enhancements made in the journal version. Submitted articles must be =
written clearly, in good English, and should not exceed 20 pages, =
everything included such as abstract, figures, tables, references, etc.

Authors should follow the Computer Networks manuscript format which can =
be found =
athttp://www.elsevier.com/journals/computer-networks/1389-1286/guide-for-a=
uthors =
<http://www.elsevier.com/journals/computer-networks/1389-1286/guide-for-au=
thors>. Manuscripts should be submitted online through the Elsevier =
Editorial System http://ees.elsevier.com/comnet/ =
<http://ees.elsevier.com/comnet/> and authors should select ' Community =
Networks ' as the article type for submission.

Hi,

I was talking with Leandro last night in the pub (which proves that there is
value in going to pubs) about something he said yesterday during his
presentation. The point he made was that implementations of IETF protocols (I am
assuming principally OLSR, but potentially this includes OSPF and BGP) in
community networks have diverged from the specifications documented in RFCs as
features and fixes have evolved.

It would be nice to have these things documented so that:
- new people can implement without having to discover and fix the
  same issues
- new implementations can be dropped into deployments with some
  chance of interoperation
- the IETF can learn and benefit from real-world experience

It seemed to us that three separate pieces of work would be valuable (possibly
repeated for each protocol)...

1. Deployment experiences and issues encountered.
What network characteristics and topologies were deployed? What was the network
stability and loading? What happened? 

2. Advice for configuration and deployment.
What values were selected for protocol parameters? What configurations worked
and didn't work? What advice can be given for specific applications?

3. Protocol issues and proposed solutions
In what way were existing protocol specifications deficient or unclear? (This
may relate back to 1 and 2). What solutions/hacks were implemented? What updates
to the RFCs should be made?

I have a little experience producing Internet-Drafts, in particular in
understanding the draft-publish-review-repeat cycle that may be unfamiliar to a
lot of you in this forum. So I'd be willing to help with the process and handle
the editorial side. Of course, I would still need the information from you.

Who would like to work with Leandro and me to make this happen?
Shall we start with OLSR and work from there?

Thanks,
Adrian

Special Issue - Research Methods for Community Informatics

 

The Journal of Community Informatics (JoCI) is seeking scholarly articles
and notes from the field for a special issue on Research Methods for
Community Informatics. Community Informatics is the study and the practice
of enabling communities with Information and Communications Technologies
(ICTs). JoCI is an international journal that focuses on how researchers and
practitioners work with communities towards the effective use of ICTs to
improve their processes, achieve their objectives, overcome the "digital
divides" that exist both within and between communities, and empower
communities and citizens. This is possible in areas such as health, cultural
production, civic management and e-governance, among others. JoCI is a focal
point for the communication of research of interest to a global network of
academics, community informatics practitioners, and national and
multi-lateral policy makers. JoCI is currently indexed in the IBSS and
Google Scholar as well as several indexes of Open Access journals. Efforts
are underway concerning additional scholarly indexing. More information
regarding JoCI is available at http://ci-journal.net.

 

The guest editors for the special issue are: Dr. Colin Rhinesmith
(University of Oklahoma, USA), Dr. Mark Wolfe (University of Alberta,
Canada), and Andy Bytheway (Retired Professor of Information Management at
the Cape Peninsula University of Technology, South Africa).

 

Objective

 

This special issue will focus on the methods used to investigate how ICTs
can support local economic development, social justice, and political
empowerment. Community Informatics (CI) is a point of convergence concerning
the use of ICTs for diverse stakeholders, including community leaders and
activists, nonprofit groups, policymakers, users/citizens, and the range of
academics working across (and integrating) disciplines as diverse as
Information Studies, Management, Computer Science, Social Work, Planning and
Development Studies. This diversity brings with it a range of methodological
approaches - and tensions - to the field of CI. The special issue seeks to
both disentangle and organize the use of existing methods in CI research and
to explore innovative new approaches used by researchers and practitioners
in their work with communities.

 

Topics

 

This special issue seeks articles focused on methodological topics and
issues related to community informatics research. We encourage contributions
that come from a wide range of perspectives, including (but not limited to):

.  Conceptual foundations. What are the pros and cons of positivist,
interpretivist, and critical methods in the CI context?

.  Data elicitation. What techniques are needed for reliable data to be
collected in local communities, and what is the role of the cloud, "big
data," and data analytics in this context?

.  Measures of success. What is the extent to which key variables and
measures of CI investment success are actually understood?

.  Ethics. How are research ethics understood in the context of CI work?

.  Comparative analysis. How can shared local and global research resources
be developed for comparative studies in different regions of the world?

.  Cross-cultural studies. How are data elicitation techniques and methods
used in a cross-cultural context?

.  Extant theory. What is the applicability of other extant theories from
related research areas (e.g., MIS, anthropology, science and technology
studies, etc.) to the field of CI methodology?

 

We also invite authors to submit "Notes from the Field" from CI
practitioners and policy makers that describe relevant methodological topics
and issues.

 

Submission procedure and deadlines

 

Full original and unpublished articles for this special issue should be
submitted via the JoCI website. Authors are invited to submit full-length
papers between 5000-7000 words and notes from the field between 3000-5000
words. All full-length research articles will be double blind peer-reviewed.
Notes from the field containing insights and analytical perspectives from
practitioners and policy makers are also encouraged - these will not be
peer-reviewed. All authors should provide a note to the editors via the
website indicating their interest in having their submissions considered for
the special issue on "Research Methods for Community Informatics."
Interested authors should consult the journal's editorial policies and
author guidelines for submissions at
http://ci-journal.net/index.php/ciej/information/authors.  

 

Full article draft submissions due: November 15, 2014.

Notes from the field due: December 15, 2014.

 

All inquiries should be directed to:

Arjuna and Adrian,

OLSR is being actively taken care of in the MANET WG by Frauenhofer.
So, I think that is OK there. In fact, that's where OLSR started and IMHO
we should simply help Frauenhofer/Henning to push for quicker adaption
there. There are some blockers which delayed some things for quite some
time.
With OLSR, this is the ETX metric discussion.

Concerning BGP: I don't think that community networks seriously diverged
from BGP per se. Often they use Mikrotiks implementation.

Hope this input helps.
Aaron.

&gt; I was talking with Leandro last night in the pub (which proves that th=

&gt;<br>
&gt; It seemed to us that three separate pieces of work would be valuable (=

&gt;<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; 2. Advice for configuration and deployment.<br>

and didn't work? What advice can be given for specific applications?

Hello Adrian, all

I think this a great effort - thanks Adrian for initiating this..

This also reminds me some of the discussions I had with Gorry, Lars and you.

There could also be opportunities for working on drafts on the effect
of the protocol changes above the network layer too for e.g. the
effect of large initial windows - it will be wonderful to hear about
deployment experiences from developing regions using a large initial
window of 10 segments..Ofcourse the folks at Google (Nandita and co)
claim a large initial windows gives a performance improvement but I am
reluctant to believe this and not sure whether they have swept the
entire parameter space! Will be great to have some knowledge on this
and possibly documented..

The same holds for the Http 2.0 based on SPDY and its effects on
pushing objects anticipating the need..how does this affect on slow
links in developing regions?

There could be more..Will be great to think about this, pursue some
work on this and document them as experiences..

Regards

We would be willing to relay experience and feedback from the community.
In the past we had rather unsuccessful attempts with OLSR Confederations
and one partially successful.
BGP is strongly rooted in all the Greek wifi communities mainly due to the
original well planed Hellenic Address Plan, the interconnection plans,  but
also due to the extensive use of mikrotik and UBNT equipment.
I agree that we should at least be able to produce a comparison map between
protocols, experiences sharing and come out with a story that could
potentially help others decide how to plan out a Community Network without
prejudiced and good practice per case.
It seems fair to all and something we have to give back.
I can help with BGP/OSPF, but OLSR is not my specialty although I am
willing to learn and listen. I find this originally interesting for me
personally so i suspect there will be lots of others that will like to see
something like that.

&gt; Thank Arjuna, this is certainly very interesting, let=E2=80=99s discus=

&gt;<br>
&gt; For now it would be good to know the opinion of academic and community=

&gt;&gt; Subject: [gaia] An Internet-Draft on &quot;Experiences with IETF P=
rotocols<br>
&gt;&gt; in Community Networks&quot;<br>
&gt;&gt; To: <a href=3D"mailto:gaia@irtf.org">gaia@irtf.org</a><br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Hi,<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; I was talking with Leandro last night in the pub (which proves tha=
t there is<br>
&gt;&gt; value in going to pubs) about something he said yesterday during h=
is<br>
&gt;&gt; presentation. The point he made was that implementations of IETF p=
rotocols (I am<br>
&gt;&gt; assuming principally OLSR, but potentially this includes OSPF and =
BGP) in<br>
&gt;&gt; community networks have diverged from the specifications documente=
d in RFCs as<br>
&gt;&gt; features and fixes have evolved.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; It would be nice to have these things documented so that:<br>
&gt;&gt; - new people can implement without having to discover and fix the<=
br>
&gt;&gt; same issues<br>
&gt;&gt; - new implementations can be dropped into deployments with some<br=
>
&gt;&gt; chance of interoperation<br>
&gt;&gt; - the IETF can learn and benefit from real-world experience<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; It seemed to us that three separate pieces of work would be valuab=
le (possibly<br>
&gt;&gt; repeated for each protocol)...<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; 1. Deployment experiences and issues encountered.<br>
&gt;&gt; What network characteristics and topologies were deployed? What wa=
s the network<br>
&gt;&gt; stability and loading? What happened?<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; 2. Advice for configuration and deployment.<br>
&gt;&gt; What values were selected for protocol parameters? What configurat=
ions worked<br>
&gt;&gt; and didn&#39;t work? What advice can be given for specific applica=
tions?<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; 3. Protocol issues and proposed solutions<br>
&gt;&gt; In what way were existing protocol specifications deficient or unc=
lear? (This<br>
&gt;&gt; may relate back to 1 and 2). What solutions/hacks were implemented=
? What updates<br>
&gt;&gt; to the RFCs should be made?<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; I have a little experience producing Internet-Drafts, in particula=
r in<br>
&gt;&gt; understanding the draft-publish-review-repeat cycle that may be un=
familiar to a<br>
&gt;&gt; lot of you in this forum. So I&#39;d be willing to help with the p=
rocess and handle<br>
&gt;&gt; the editorial side. Of course, I would still need the information =
from you.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Who would like to work with Leandro and me to make this happen?<br=
>
&gt;&gt; Shall we start with OLSR and work from there?<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Thanks,<br>
&gt;&gt; Adrian<br>

Hi Arjuna,

we also have some activities and works that impact routing standards,
and OLSR in particular. For instance this work
Leonardo Maccari, Renato Lo Cigno,
"A Week in the Life of Three Large Wireless Community Networks",
Ad Hoc Networks, Available online 7 August 2014 [*]
shows that link quality in the end has little impact on choices.

We are also working on other aspects of MPR selection (we presented
preliminar results at CNBuB 2012) and will have a full paper with
interesting results soon.

Cheers
Renato & Leonardo

It seems that the vision for cheap Internet access does not resonate 
with the Hungarian government.

very odd - in the UK I think we pay VAT on our broadband service, so the gov already gets money (and the faster the service, the
more we pay, so the more tax they get)

the hungarians are performing some sort of internet-death-wish - the tax wont raise much more money (if it did, people will
downrate their links and pay less for the lease which might make service providers, who also pay tax, go broke)

its kind of government imposed non neutrality


doh!

 cheers

It seems quite a few democratic aspects haven't been resonating too
well with Hungary's government lately...  This would fit the bill.

This might be a trend, just more visible in the Hungary case. Here in Swede=
n the public TV broadcast administration decided to claim that the ownershi=
p of a computer possble to connect to the internet is ground for paying the=
 same obligatory TV broadcast fee as all who own TV sets shall pay. (As the=
y make some of their material avalable "for free" on the web and "anyone" c=
an therefore access it). I assume it was computers with some sort of screen=
, that is ;-) For this time they had to pay the fees back that they had alr=
eady collected. =0A=

I was hoping that the economics profession had moved away from the pure

minute-by-minute basis), but apparently behavioral economics is still a new
concept... I recommend reading Odlyzko's work for balance.

Interesting.  I read the original Odlyzko paper. This quote from the =
abstract is telling:

"In a rapidly growing market, it is in the service providers=E2=80=99 =
interest to encourage usage, and that argues for simple, preferably flat =
rate, pricing.=E2=80=9D

I can=E2=80=99t think of a single access ISP these days in the US who is =
trying to *increase* usage, especially at peak times.  In that vein, I =
think several axioms from this work probably need to be re-evaluated in =
the context of today=E2=80=99s Internet:

1. ISPs are clearly no longer trying to =E2=80=9Cencourage usage=E2=80=9D,=
 so the basic axiom that leads to the conclusion about flat-rate pricing =
may no longer hold. Odlyzko=E2=80=99s paper talks about how metered =
pricing does decrease usage=E2=80=94that=E2=80=99s *exactly* what the =
mechanisms in the Tech Review article is talking about (specifically, =
reducing usage during peak times to shift to other times of day).

2. One of the primary arguments for flat-rate pricing that Odlyzko talks =
about is that flate-rate pricing will cause consumers to use the network =
more (vs. a conventional dialup user) and=E2=80=94as a result=E2=80=94want=
 to upgrade to higher service tiers.  This may still be true, but I =
don=E2=80=99t think it=E2=80=99s necessarily the case.  I=E2=80=99d =
think there are plenty of =E2=80=9Calways on=E2=80=9D / heavy users who =
are not necessarily on the highest service tier.

3. It is unclear from the paper whether users=E2=80=99 aversion to =
usage-based pricing is fundamental, or whether this preference stems =
simply from the fact that today=E2=80=99s UIs for usage-based =
billing/monitoring are difficult to understand.

So, I don=E2=80=99t think that the conclusions of the work from an =
Internet that predates heavy congestion due to new applications =
necessarily hold.  (They certainly may, but the conclusions don't strike =
me as automatically applicable.)

as usual, 99% of this article is US centric , whilst most the world is in a
different place with regards capacity, access network technology
deployment/competition, and pricing/neutrality models (actually, several
different places:)

for me, if you price usage (volume/rate) too steeply, you wont incent
deployment of new technology- i t isn't about squeezing a bit more capacity
out of dsl, cable tv or 2.5 or 4G nets, its going from copper to fiber, or
from 3G to 4G (or 5G now which is already in planning) -

so there's a tension between managing congestion of your existing
deployment, and giving users hope there's a point in paying towards upgrade
to new tech - this means the system of providers and users doesn't move on
smooth curves, but in a series of lurches (rise and run of the staircase
being determined by logistics of deployment - say nearly 10 year time frame
for near full deployment of new tech to a typical eu size country, with
speed increases not double per year (which would give you 1000 in a decade
- true in aggregate, but for individuals, more like a bit above linear
increase so 10-100)

the other thing is that we don't move to faster use of existing apps as
much as new models of apps - so an interesting paper on mobile apps points
out the times-of-india mobile site generates 132 tcp connections with
adverts and only 6 to the browser without....

but also, decent 3G and 4G performance is predicated on people actually
using mobile video (answer, they do a bit on 3G, they do a lot more on 4G)
- if you volume/time price or set the cap too low, then you create a trap
you can't get out of moving from 3G to 4G...

as Henning and others point out, the other thing is people aren't rational
- in fact this is very clear given what most people (in the UK) pay for
mobile contracts (severely sub-optional in terms of price and requirements
-i.e. way too much) - this is probably because a) as part of dispolsable
income, even a high end mobile or fast broadband line is a very small
fraction of disposable income for a household (compared with housing,
energy  and food) and b) users don't like making a lot of decisions about
small transactions (i.e. they'll pay to not have the mental/cognitive
hassle)....

the same reason for why smart metering for other utilities (electricity,
gas/ water) doesn't work as a behaviourla nudge, at all (as measured in
several large deployments)

somehow, telco/internet world needs to read the utility economics
literature and get on track:)

Hi,
I agree with most of this discussion but I want to be careful about some
economics definitions:

dispolsable income, even a high end mobile or fast broadband line is a very
small fraction of disposable income for a household (compared with housing,
energy  and food) and b) users don't like making a lot of decisions about
small transactions (i.e. they'll pay to not have the mental/cognitive
hassle)....

In fact, I think that the behavior that Jon describes above is very
rational. For a typical middle-class person in a developed country, the
time/value required to analyze usage, research plans, calculate which plan
is the least expensive, and sign up for that plan often exceeds the benefit
of doing so compared to picking a contract. The danger of lost
connectivity/productivity if you suddenly run out of bandwidth or units is
another incentive to use a subscription. In the US there is so little
competitition that the providers can make the prepaid pay-for-usage option
especially unattractive; in Europe there are better pay-for-usage options
but the sheer number of them to analyze is quite high. By comparison the
prepaid bundles available in the Philippines and Haiti are competitively
priced, easy to understand and relatively straightforward to activate. In
some countries mobile operators blur the distinction between prepaid and
postpaid by offering unlimited bundles that can be reactivated every month
and automatic bank transfers to top-up your prepaid mobile balance. The
lower the decision-making cost and the more competition for non-subscrition
plans with good value, the more people will select prepaid and pay-by-usage
plans.
Thanks,

Nick, Jon, Henning, all,

It will be interesting to see how the notion of demand side management
will be effective in reducing peak network usage even though several
studies have shown this to be effective for e.g TUBE (SIGCOMM 2012)
and Nishanth's WWW papers etc..

I think the success of such models will also depend on many factors
including the level of granularity, person's spending habits etc..

I have friends who always keep an eye on the online grocery - check
day to day what is on offer and buying certain groceries from
different stores (that involves commuting)( while I just go and buy
from tesco's and cannot be bothered with all these hassles..but yes if
I can watch a VoD at lower cost since I am getting that video few
hours late is fine with me (I could just do the day before I want to
watch)..

Many in developing regions care about money and layering different
pricing schemes and incentivising demand side management and doing
other SDP may be beneficial and could work..

Will be interesting to ponder more through GAIA and some of us are
working on this currently..

Regards

Currently, at least in the US, a large fraction of the smartphone (and an
even larger fraction of tablet) data usage is via Wi-Fi. Indeed, most
mobile OS seem to have the feature of automatically delaying software
updates and photo uploads until Wi-Fi is available, essentially creating a
two-tier system. (This obviously relies on an environment where most people
have "free" access either at home or at work.) Today, there is very little
Netflix and other long-form video viewing over 4G.

I suspect few would object to better automation of, say, video sideloading,
but a lot of video consumption is spur-of-the-moment - pre-planning to
download the cat videos linked from the Facebook newsfeed isn't exactly
realistic. I also suspect that there's a high spatial correlation of demand
- everybody checking Facebook while waiting for trains during the morning
commute, etc.  However, given the near-absence of long-form video viewing
over LTE today, this is very unlikely to make a difference in the load
factor for cell systems.

Satellite already has two-tier pricing, with no metering during the wee
hours of the morning.

The earlier article on smart data pricing noted in the correction at the
bottom that the variable-rate pricing option has not yet been implemented.
Not surprising - if so, this would basically kill video advertisements and
Facebook, given their video auto-play options. You'd have to put a dollar
figure next to each advertisement. Given adaptive bit-rates, you'd have to
provide range estimates. ("Watching this ad could cost you between $0.10
and $0.20." [For a 60-second pre-roll, this is not completely off, at least
at higher resolution and the typical US $10/GB plan. Presumably, peak
pricing would have to be significantly higher to make a difference in
load.])

Most people today, as Rohan and Jon mention, are not on metered pricing,
but on buckets. Thus, I suspect the real implementation of variable pricing
would be that the meter runs faster during congestion, which then leads to
the kind of end-of-month hassle that few would find attractive. I really
don't need one more thing to argue with my teenage daughter about...

An interesting related article is

http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2013/09/poverty_and_cognitive_impairment_study_shows_money_troubles_make_decision.html

Two of the most common complaints about carriers at the FCC are about data
caps and billing surprises ("bill shock"). Variable-rate pricing has the
great potential to combine the "best" of both...

Hennig, Jon, Arjuna,

I'm going to be the broken record, or the boring bass drum; hopefully I =
won't be a pest, but to move the needle on Global access to the =
Internet, I think we need to figure how to do some of:

* Make the Internet *much* cheaper (not 2x, but 10x), so it's not a =
large fraction of income.  Cellular has done this for voice; we need to =
do it for data/Internet
* Make the Internet *much* faster. E.G. move from 2G/100kbps to 2mbps, =
at the same price
* Bring the Internet to new areas, or at least bring this 10x the places =
with the worst speeds and highest cost compared to average income

All of those are good engineering/research objectives.

I would think these pricing and demand based schemes might possibly =
approach 2x improvement by taking more money from those willing to pay =
more and moving some of the demand to off-peak times and taking better =
account of behavioral economics, but they won't make a 10x change or =
take it to new geographies.  Something, or some combination of things, =
will make a 10x change; certainly Moore's Law is supportive of that.=20

There's lots of people & work to improve the Internet in the US, UK, EU, =
East Asia, but to get to places where it's not now, or where it's now =
lousy, to borrow the tag line of a political campaign, I suggest "It's =
the cost, dummy!".  (Not calling anyone here dummies, but I like the =
internal line from the first Clinton campaign; they kept reminding =
themselves "It's the economy, dummy!").

  -- Jim

PS: To echo Rohan's comment: I think pre-pay is the major payment method =
in many places that seem like they would be target geographies for GAIA. =
 We might think it's inefficient and not a good value for money, =
especially when bought in small pieces, but think of it as a =
cash-managment strategy: rather than commit to fixed monthly charges, =
people that are barely getting by can simply not buy Internet for a week =
and buy food or medicine or school fees instead.

PPS: I'm staying at a very nice place at  31=B059'5.71"N,  =
75=B057'51.60"E.  With an Airtel mobile broadband connection, Netradar =
usually fails to connect. With AirJaldi's wifi based broadband, I get =
~1.2Mbps.  This nice place can afford AirJaldi, but we'd need to be at =
least 10x cheaper for most local people to afford it.

Hi Henning, all,

in the US are already a reality in other parts of the world.  To name a =
few instances where things are different:

* Cellular data is more common than fixed line in many parts Africa, by =
a ratio of about 30:1 (according to the ITU in 2013), so many of the =
=E2=80=9CWiFi offloading=E2=80=9D arguments may not apply.  Even where =
they do, fixed-line Internet subscriptions are expensive (though not as =
expensive as cellular), usage-based (and sometimes shaped in response to =
usage), and often capped at a few GB per month.  (That said, there is no =
Netflix in many of these places, and performance is poor enough that =
video can be difficult to watch, in any case.)

* Some countries already price data differently during peak hours; South =
Africa, for example, has ISPs that cell =E2=80=9Cnighttime data =

Agree.  The US-centric nature of the net neutrality debate ignores the fact
that the infrastructure choke points are different in emerging markets.

This is true now but the explosion of undersea and terrestrial fibre
projects in the last five years (I am thinking of sub-Saharan Africa in
particular) are changing the game.  It is not unreasonable to suppose that
within a very few years, all primary and secondary cities in Africa will
have fibre.  This is a great potential enabler for local ISPs that can use
unlicensed and (hopefully soon) dynamic spectrum to deliver services.

In Germany, the percentage of smartphone data going over WiFi is now above
90%.  Across 70 countries, according to Mobidia, the average is about 80%.
I utterly fail to see why these astounding statistics are ignored by most
countries from a national strategic perspective.

yes, and other less explicit strategies such as bittorrent throttling
during business hours but not at night

My revolutionary zero-rating thought of the day is that I would love to see
an African mobile operator zero-rate 2G access.  T-Mobile in the US do this
for their roaming customers.  Not only would this democratise access to the
Internet but I would bet it would drive 3G adoption and market share in a
manner that would ultimately drive up their profits.

&gt;<br>
&gt; Currently, at least in the US, a large fraction of the smartphone (and=
 an even larger fraction of tablet) data usage is via Wi-Fi. Indeed, most m=
obile OS seem to have the feature of automatically delaying software update=
s and photo uploads until Wi-Fi is available, essentially creating a two-ti=
er system. (This obviously relies on an environment where most people have =
&quot;free&quot; access either at home or at work.) Today, there is very li=
ttle Netflix and other long-form video viewing over 4G.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I suspect few would object to better automation of, say, video sideloa=
ding, but a lot of video consumption is spur-of-the-moment - pre-planning t=
o download the cat videos linked from the Facebook newsfeed isn&#39;t exact=
ly realistic. I also suspect that there&#39;s a high spatial correlation of=
 demand - everybody checking Facebook while waiting for trains during the m=
orning commute, etc.=C2=A0 However, given the near-absence of long-form vid=
eo viewing over LTE today, this is very unlikely to make a difference in th=
e load factor for cell systems.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Satellite already has two-tier pricing, with no metering during the we=
e hours of the morning.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; The earlier article on smart data pricing noted in the correction at t=
he bottom that the variable-rate pricing option has not yet been implemente=
d. Not surprising - if so, this would basically kill video advertisements a=
nd Facebook, given their video auto-play options. You&#39;d have to put a d=
ollar figure next to each advertisement. Given adaptive bit-rates, you&#39;=
d have to provide range estimates. (&quot;Watching this ad could cost you b=
etween $0.10 and $0.20.&quot; [For a 60-second pre-roll, this is not comple=
tely off, at least at higher resolution and the typical US $10/GB plan. Pre=
sumably, peak pricing would have to be significantly higher to make a diffe=
rence in load.])<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Most people today, as Rohan and Jon mention, are not on metered pricin=
g, but on buckets. Thus, I suspect the real implementation of variable pric=

All this indicates to me that there is a place for both mobile and fixed =
infrastructure.  Fixed line infrastructure is generally derived from =
copper pairs, or perhaps more generally, from poles & conduits which can =
carry copper pairs and fiber strands.  In the target geographies for =
GAIA (as I understand the charter), there is some, but very, very little =
fixed line services.  Thus, mobile voice and mobile broadband have =
exploded.  That's great.

EU, the US, and East Asia have a fixed line legacy, and the result is =
that if one wants Internet to a place, as opposed to Internet to a small =
device easily carried around, then you have can easily have high speed =
at a low cost. Consumers of fixed line services are used to consuming =
100GB/month or more; Comcast starts being unhappy at consumers of more =
than 200 GB/month I think.  In the same geographies, mobile service =
start to add fees over 1 or 2GB.  The costs for either fixed or mobile =
service are within a factor of 2, but the capacity consumed is different =
by about 100x.

thesis) relevant to the research area or equivalent qualifications

Demonstrated research competence through high-quality and high-impact
publications in top conferences and journals

The candidates should demonstrate strong systems skills in one or more
of the following: Linux kernel programming, Click Modular Router
platform, ns-3, Blackadder and OpenSand. Prior experience building
testbeds and real-world deployments are considered an advantage

Proven experience in building Information Centric Systems is
considered an advantage

Experience with satellite/wireless networking

Experience with Quality of Service techniques, Radio Resource
Management, efficient edge caching techniques and/or security
strategies are considered an advantage.

Candidates holding some of the skills and experience mentioned above
may be considered for this position but will be appointed on the
Research Assistant scale (=C2=A324,775-=C2=A327,864).

The expected start date will be February 2015.

	This is happening other places - here's an article in Danish:

	http://www.version2.dk/artikel/mobilsurf-danske-teleselskaber-sender-dit-telefonnummer-til-hjemmesider-70145

	Google translate can probably do a good job of summarising it :)

	The problem was already brought up back in 2012.

I think this is a _very_ interesting challenge - well said! A lot of
western broadband providers claim they are making no money, but they seem
not to go broke very often, so I doubt it
but the idea of reducing cost of provision by 10x is really interesting - I
think there's probably a bunch of new techniques that could do an end run
on all this ancient copper and fiber stuff that seems to be causeing them
headaches:)

the other thing is the price of edge systems (switch/router) really should
be in the 1$ range (we can build you a decent home server on an arduino,
raspberry pi or cubieboard, including running secure web services, for
about 30$ for 1 (i.e. 10$ for 1000s...)

Generally, and this appears to be true for both the US and Europe (I
haven't looked closely at other regions), telecommunications companies
spend about 10-15% of their revenue on capital expenditures. For US cable
companies, a large fraction (more than half, in some cases) are set top
boxes. Thus, reducing network build cost helps, particularly for new
entrants, but unless we figure out what the other 85-90% are spent on, this
may miss the mark.

If somebody has more detailed cost breakdowns for telco/ISP expenditures,
that would be very helpful. The typical annual report data is not very
informative, but that's all I have.

 I am reminded of the CAP theorem from distributed systems: pick any
two out of three (we cant have everything unfortunately) - so
somewhere we should compromise :)

usually there's a process engineering approach to reducing costs that gets
better with scale very fast - it seems some of this hasn't yet happened to IP
(althugh maybe IP networks did it to telcos) - so we need something disruptive
in the operational side of things to help make this happen

SDN (and its predecessors) was touted as one of the tools for this

perhaps the emperor has no clothes:)

Henning,

Neil Davies (cc-ed here) gave a presentation at the GAIA workshop in
Cambridge last week on where the costs where for ISPs - the slides are
not online currently - it will be interesting to get his thoughts
documented here too..

Indeed, this is good - but fibre to a city - does not mean everyone can 
access the fibre across the city, suburbs and ebyond.

As I noted in conversations at the Cambridge meeting, we have in the UK 
an ambitious plan for widescale fibre roll-out and 3G/4G services - 
however for many (maybe 15-25, we can argue details) this infrastructure 
is not economic - the last mile costs are considerable in rural areas. 
In countries with less developed infrastructure, there will be many 
beyond the reach of the high-speed fibre rings.

And my concern would be if *WE* choose based upon our perception of the 
user requirements - enabling people to become on-line is I suggest a 
real priority But not one size fits all, that's why I argued for more
