Web Foundation responds to India consultation on net neutrality

Net neutrality — the principle that all internet traffic be treated 
equally — is fundamental to our mission to deliver digital equality — a 
world where everyone has the same rights and opportunities online. Why? 
If dominant content providers can pay to have their traffic prioritised, 
it risks harming competition and innovation, while limiting freedom of 
expression. If governments block or censor content that they do not 
agree with, it hurts free speech and democracy.

Today, in partnership with the Digital Empowerment Foundation 
<https://defindia.org/>(DEF), the Web Foundation has made a submission 
<http://webfoundation.org/docs/2017/03/WFDEFResponsetoTRAIcallforcommentsonNN-Mar14-FINAL.pdf> 
to an important consultation on net neutrality in India. Responding to 
questions from Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), the Web 
Foundation and DEF have jointly made four key recommendations:

*1) Consider introducing a no-fee basic data allowance*
Today, mobile broadband penetration is India is estimated to be less 
than 10% (GSMA Intelligence Q4 2016). Addressing this challenge will 
require innovative interventions which should be encouraged by the 
government. However, we argue that interventions to provide access for 
low-income and/or marginalised communities must also adhere to net 
neutrality principles, as they should for all Indians. Previous attempts 
in India include zero-rating programmes which restricted users to a 
limited set of sites or services, and these proved controversial. 
Meanwhile, research 
<http://1e8q3q16vyc81g8l3h3md6q5f5e.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/MeasuringImpactsofMobileDataServices_ResearchBrief2.pdf>by 
the Alliance for Affordable Internet has suggested such zero rating 
initiatives are not effective in bringing new users online, and that 
users would rather have free access to the whole internet, even if it is 
limited by time or data allocation. Our joint suggestion is for TRAI to 
explore ways to provide a basic monthly data allowance. Other countries, 
such as Colombia 
<http://a4ai.org/affordability-report/report/2017/#which_countries_top_the_2017_adi?>, 
are already experimenting with such policies: given the size of India’s 
market and the country’s global influence, the successful implementation 
of such an initiative could be world-leading and transformative.

*2) Encourage TSPs to make detailed information available on important 
areas such as quality of service and network neutrality compliance— in 
open data formats wherever possible*
In order for regulators, citizens and civil society to monitor progress 
and ensure traffic management practices abide by net neutrality 
guidelines, detailed information that can easily be analysed is needed. 
For this reason, we propose that TSPs be required to make detailed, 
technical filings with TRAI either quarterly or bi-annually, and to post 
the results on their websites too. Wherever feasible, this information 
should be released as open data 
<https://blog.okfn.org/2013/10/03/defining-open-data/>— free for anyone 
to reuse or analyse — in order to maximise transparency and accountability.

*3) Don’t ban paid service-specific data bundles *—*unless there is a 
relationship between mobile operators and content providers*
We argue that application-specific traffic discrimination should not be 
allowed. However, one exception is the case of service-specific data 
bundles — where TSPs charge different rates for access to certain sites 
or applications. Such bundles can be a good way for operators to respond 
to customer demand and devise innovative ways for more people to connect 
and communicate affordably. As such, we recommend that they should be 
encouraged, with any complaints dealt with on a case-by-case basis. The 
caveats, of course, are if there is a commercial relationship between 
TSPs and the sites or applications included in the bundle or if the 
content is not available on a non-exclusive basis to all TSPs; in such 
cases, we believe that service-specific data bundles should not be allowed.

*4) Consider creating a dedicated advisory committee on net neutrality 
*—*with representatives from government, business and civil society*
It is clear that net neutrality is a vital issue. Preserving and 
enhancing it will help Indian entrepreneurs and established businesses 
alike, and can help millions more to connect affordably. Yet it is also 
a complex issue, which will continue to shift and evolve over time. For 
this reason, we recommend that TRAI considers establishing a dedicated 
advisory committee on net neutrality, made up of representatives from 
business, government, academia and civil society. One of the most 
important mandates of this committee would be to explore the 
implications of emerging technologies on the principles of network 
neutrality, which TRAI should revisit every two years to allow for agile 
policy design. We do not envision this body as one that can take actions 
in case of any violation of network neutrality. However, the committee 
would be able to make recommendations directly to TRAI.

consultation on net neutrality in 2015, which can be //accessed here/

Thanks for sharing Willi.

I am finding it hard to understand the benefits of recommendation 3.
"Don=E2=80=99t ban paid service-specific data bundles"

Cheers,
Tomslin

Web Foundation responds to India consultation on net neutrality

Net neutrality =E2=80=94 the principle that all internet traffic be treated=
 equally
=E2=80=94 is fundamental to our mission to deliver digital equality =E2=80=
=94 a world where
everyone has the same rights and opportunities online. Why? If dominant
content providers can pay to have their traffic prioritised, it risks
harming competition and innovation, while limiting freedom of expression.
If governments block or censor content that they do not agree with, it
hurts free speech and democracy.

Today, in partnership with the Digital Empowerment Foundation <
https://defindia.org/>(DEF), the Web Foundation has made a submission <
http://webfoundation.org/docs/2017/03/WFDEFResponsetoTRAIca
llforcommentsonNN-Mar14-FINAL.pdf> to an important consultation on net
neutrality in India. Responding to questions from Telecom Regulatory
Authority of India (TRAI), the Web Foundation and DEF have jointly made
four key recommendations:

*1) Consider introducing a no-fee basic data allowance*
Today, mobile broadband penetration is India is estimated to be less than
10% (GSMA Intelligence Q4 2016). Addressing this challenge will require
innovative interventions which should be encouraged by the government.
However, we argue that interventions to provide access for low-income
and/or marginalised communities must also adhere to net neutrality
principles, as they should for all Indians. Previous attempts in India
include zero-rating programmes which restricted users to a limited set of
sites or services, and these proved controversial. Meanwhile, research <
http://1e8q3q16vyc81g8l3h3md6q5f5e.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/
wp-content/uploads/2016/05/MeasuringImpactsofMobileDataServi
ces_ResearchBrief2.pdf>by the Alliance for Affordable Internet has
suggested such zero rating initiatives are not effective in bringing new
users online, and that users would rather have free access to the whole
internet, even if it is limited by time or data allocation. Our joint
suggestion is for TRAI to explore ways to provide a basic monthly data
allowance. Other countries, such as Colombia <http://a4ai.org/affordability
-report/report/2017/#which_countries_top_the_2017_adi?>, are already
experimenting with such policies: given the size of India=E2=80=99s market =
and the
country=E2=80=99s global influence, the successful implementation of such a=
n
initiative could be world-leading and transformative.

*2) Encourage TSPs to make detailed information available on important
areas such as quality of service and network neutrality compliance=E2=80=94=
 in open
data formats wherever possible*
In order for regulators, citizens and civil society to monitor progress and
ensure traffic management practices abide by net neutrality guidelines,
detailed information that can easily be analysed is needed. For this
reason, we propose that TSPs be required to make detailed, technical
filings with TRAI either quarterly or bi-annually, and to post the results
on their websites too. Wherever feasible, this information should be
released as open data <https://blog.okfn.org/2013/10/03/defining-open-data/=
>=E2=80=94
free for anyone to reuse or analyse =E2=80=94 in order to maximise transpar=
ency and
accountability.

*3) Don=E2=80=99t ban paid service-specific data bundles *=E2=80=94*unless =
there is a
relationship between mobile operators and content providers*
We argue that application-specific traffic discrimination should not be
allowed. However, one exception is the case of service-specific data
bundles =E2=80=94 where TSPs charge different rates for access to certain s=
ites or
applications. Such bundles can be a good way for operators to respond to
customer demand and devise innovative ways for more people to connect and
communicate affordably. As such, we recommend that they should be
encouraged, with any complaints dealt with on a case-by-case basis. The
caveats, of course, are if there is a commercial relationship between TSPs
and the sites or applications included in the bundle or if the content is
not available on a non-exclusive basis to all TSPs; in such cases, we
believe that service-specific data bundles should not be allowed.

*4) Consider creating a dedicated advisory committee on net neutrality
*=E2=80=94*with representatives from government, business and civil society=
*
It is clear that net neutrality is a vital issue. Preserving and enhancing
it will help Indian entrepreneurs and established businesses alike, and can
help millions more to connect affordably. Yet it is also a complex issue,
which will continue to shift and evolve over time. For this reason, we
recommend that TRAI considers establishing a dedicated advisory committee
on net neutrality, made up of representatives from business, government,
academia and civil society. One of the most important mandates of this
committee would be to explore the implications of emerging technologies on
the principles of network neutrality, which TRAI should revisit every two
years to allow for agile policy design. We do not envision this body as one
that can take actions in case of any violation of network neutrality.
However, the committee would be able to make recommendations directly to
TRAI.

By coincidence, yesterday I had a paid gig shooting an investment meeting.
One of the presenters was http://www.mavin.co/ who, under the name Gigato,
is in the business of selling free data sponsorships in India. Anybody can
pay to sponsor free data, say 1GB or more, to an end user, perhaps as a
loyalty reward. The proviso is that this can be used by the recipient to
access any content/service they like.

Apparently this is looked on with favor by the local regulators as a method
of enabling access to the underserved while not walling off any gardens.
And the company is doing very well.

Web Foundation responds to India consultation on net neutrality<br>
<br>
Net neutrality =E2=80=94 the principle that all internet traffic be treated=
 equally =E2=80=94 is fundamental to our mission to deliver digital equalit=
y =E2=80=94 a world where everyone has the same rights and opportunities on=
line. Why? If dominant content providers can pay to have their traffic prio=
ritised, it risks harming competition and innovation, while limiting freedo=
m of expression. If governments block or censor content that they do not ag=
ree with, it hurts free speech and democracy.<br>
<br>
Today, in partnership with the Digital Empowerment Foundation &lt;<a href=
=3D"https://defindia.org/" rel=3D"noreferrer" target=3D"_blank">https://def=
india.org/</a>&gt;(DEF), the Web Foundation has made a submission &lt;<a hr=
ef=3D"http://webfoundation.org/docs/2017/03/WFDEFResponsetoTRAIcallforcomme=
ntsonNN-Mar14-FINAL.pdf" rel=3D"noreferrer" target=3D"_blank">http://webfou=
ndation.org/docs<wbr>/2017/03/WFDEFResponsetoTRAIca<wbr>llforcommentsonNN-M=
ar14-FINAL.<wbr>pdf</a>&gt; to an important consultation on net neutrality =
in India. Responding to questions from Telecom Regulatory Authority of Indi=
a (TRAI), the Web Foundation and DEF have jointly made four key recommendat=
ions:<br>
<br>
*1) Consider introducing a no-fee basic data allowance*<br>
Today, mobile broadband penetration is India is estimated to be less than 1=
0% (GSMA Intelligence Q4 2016). Addressing this challenge will require inno=
vative interventions which should be encouraged by the government. However,=
 we argue that interventions to provide access for low-income and/or margin=
alised communities must also adhere to net neutrality principles, as they s=
hould for all Indians. Previous attempts in India include zero-rating progr=
ammes which restricted users to a limited set of sites or services, and the=
se proved controversial. Meanwhile, research &lt;<a href=3D"http://1e8q3q16=
vyc81g8l3h3md6q5f5e.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Meas=

com/<wbr>wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Mea<wbr>suringImpactsofMobileDataServi<=
wbr>ces_ResearchBrief2.pdf</a>&gt;by the Alliance for Affordable Internet h=
as suggested such zero rating initiatives are not effective in bringing new=
 users online, and that users would rather have free access to the whole in=
ternet, even if it is limited by time or data allocation. Our joint suggest=
ion is for TRAI to explore ways to provide a basic monthly data allowance. =
Other countries, such as Colombia &lt;<a href=3D"http://a4ai.org/affordabil=
ity-report/report/2017/#which_countries_top_the_2017_adi" rel=3D"noreferrer=
" target=3D"_blank">http://a4ai.org/affordability<wbr>-report/report/2017/#=
which_cou<wbr>ntries_top_the_2017_adi</a>?&gt;, are already experimenting w=
ith such policies: given the size of India=E2=80=99s market and the country=
=E2=80=99s global influence, the successful implementation of such an initi=
ative could be world-leading and transformative.<br>
<br>
*2) Encourage TSPs to make detailed information available on important area=
s such as quality of service and network neutrality compliance=E2=80=94 in =
open data formats wherever possible*<br>
In order for regulators, citizens and civil society to monitor progress and=
 ensure traffic management practices abide by net neutrality guidelines, de=
tailed information that can easily be analysed is needed. For this reason, =
we propose that TSPs be required to make detailed, technical filings with T=
RAI either quarterly or bi-annually, and to post the results on their websi=
tes too. Wherever feasible, this information should be released as open dat=
a &lt;<a href=3D"https://blog.okfn.org/2013/10/03/defining-open-data/" rel=
=3D"noreferrer" target=3D"_blank">https://blog.okfn.org/2013/10<wbr>/03/def=
ining-open-data/</a>&gt;=E2=80=94 free for anyone to reuse or analyse =E2=
=80=94 in order to maximise transparency and accountability.<br>
<br>
*3) Don=E2=80=99t ban paid service-specific data bundles *=E2=80=94*unless =
there is a relationship between mobile operators and content providers*<br>
We argue that application-specific traffic discrimination should not be all=
owed. However, one exception is the case of service-specific data bundles =
=E2=80=94 where TSPs charge different rates for access to certain sites or =
applications. Such bundles can be a good way for operators to respond to cu=
stomer demand and devise innovative ways for more people to connect and com=
municate affordably. As such, we recommend that they should be encouraged, =
with any complaints dealt with on a case-by-case basis. The caveats, of cou=
rse, are if there is a commercial relationship between TSPs and the sites o=
r applications included in the bundle or if the content is not available on=
 a non-exclusive basis to all TSPs; in such cases, we believe that service-=
specific data bundles should not be allowed.<br>
<br>
*4) Consider creating a dedicated advisory committee on net neutrality *=E2=
=80=94*with representatives from government, business and civil society*<br=
>
It is clear that net neutrality is a vital issue. Preserving and enhancing =
it will help Indian entrepreneurs and established businesses alike, and can=
 help millions more to connect affordably. Yet it is also a complex issue, =
which will continue to shift and evolve over time. For this reason, we reco=
mmend that TRAI considers establishing a dedicated advisory committee on ne=
t neutrality, made up of representatives from business, government, academi=
a and civil society. One of the most important mandates of this committee w=
ould be to explore the implications of emerging technologies on the princip=
les of network neutrality, which TRAI should revisit every two years to all=
ow for agile policy design. We do not envision this body as one that can ta=
ke actions in case of any violation of network neutrality. However, the com=
mittee would be able to make recommendations directly to TRAI.<br>

> Call for Papers
> ---------------
>=20
> The second edition of the ACM, IRTF & ISOC Applied Networking Research
> Workshop 2017 (ANRW=E2=80=9917) is an academic workshop that provides =
a forum
> for researchers, vendors, network operators and the Internet standards
> community to present and discuss emerging results in applied
> networking research. It is sponsored by ACM SIGCOMM, the Internet
> Research Task Force (IRTF) and the Internet Society (ISOC).
>=20
> Researchers should consider submitting early/emerging results that
> illustrate the scientific and engineering principles underlying the
> Internet architecture, protocols and applications; that demonstrate
> new capabilities, features, or extensions to the Internet protocol
> layers; that enhance our understanding of how Internet protocols work
> in real-world deployments or realistic test-beds; or that improve
> Internet security and privacy, scalability, performance, and
> robustness.
>=20
> The ANRW=E2=80=9917 particularly encourages the submission of results =
that
> could form the basis for future engineering work in the IETF, that
> could change operational Internet practices, that can help better
> specify Internet protocols, or that could influence further research
> and experimentation in the IRTF.
>=20
> Topics of Interest
> ------------------
>=20
> Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, applied work in
> the following areas:
>=20
> * Evolving Internet architecture and deployment of new Internet
>  working paradigms
> * Naming, addressing, and routing for the (future) Internet
> * Development and deployment of new and improved transport protocols
> * Congestion control for heterogeneous networks and novel applications
> * Improvements to the security and privacy of Internet protocols
> * Studies that characterize Internet security, privacy or censorship
> * Measuring and understanding the behavior and transparency of the
>  Internet
> * Internetworking and semantic interoperability for
>  resource-constrained devices
> * New approaches to network management, operations, and control
> * Better ways of specifying protocols, including usable techniques for
>  protocol verification
> * Enabling global access to the Internet
> * Improving the energy efficiency of the Internet
> * Protocols and APIs for new Internet applications
> * New approaches to decentralized mobility management
> * Application of network programmability to the Internet
> * Approaches towards decentralizing and democratizing the Internet
> * Systems and protocols that enable extending the reach of the =
Internet
>=20
>=20
> Full papers and short papers
> ----------------------------
>=20
> The ANRW accepts two types of submissions: full papers and short =
papers.
>=20
> Full paper submissions describe original research on the topics above
> and may contain up to six pages of technical content, including
> figures, tables, appendices, etc. plus unlimited pages for references
> and acknowledgements only. The six page limit is strictly enforced,
> even a single line exceeding six pages will lead to rejection without
> review. We expect full papers to contain at least a preliminary
> evaluation.
>=20
> Accepted full papers will be presented and discussed in depth at the
> workshop, and will be published in the ACM Digital Library.
>=20
> Short paper submissions are suitable for short position papers, for
> starting a discussion on new technical ideas, to present very early
> results, or to present other topics of interest to the community
> (software and tools, research initiatives or collaborative projects,
> major new funding vessels, etc.). They may contain up to two pages of
> content including figures, tables, any appendices, etc., optionally
> followed by a single additional page for references and
> acknowledgments only.
>=20
> Accepted short papers will be briefly presented during the workshop,
> and will be published in the ACM Digital Library.
>=20
> Authors of accepted short papers should also bring a poster presenting
> its content to the workshop, for display and more in-depth discussion
> with interested participants during the breaks.
>=20
>=20
> Under no circumstances should authors submit previously published
> work, submit the same work simultaneously to multiple venues, or
> submit papers that plagiarize the work of other authors. The ACM
> Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism applies to the ANRW, and action
> will be taken against submitters who have engaged in such practices.
>=20
> Papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement requests will not be
> considered for review or publication, nor ever be disclosed.

Dear all,

Two points that require your immediate attention :-)

First, please spread the word about the open letter to EU policy makers 
signed
by more than 30 EU Community Networks and more than 35 supporting 
organizations
around the word. The joint press release is available here:

http://netcommons.eu/?q=news/open-letter-eu-policy-makers-community-networks

Second, if any of you plans to submit a paper for the technical 
programme of the
interdisciplinary workshop on DIY and Community Networking at IFIP 
Networking,
Stockholm, June 12th, please note that the *deadline for abstract 
submission is
today* and should be done through EDAS conference management system here:

https://edas.info/newPaper.php?c=23331&track=83760

If you have any questions for the final paper (deadline March 30th) or you
want to submit an "experimental" submission, please let us know at 
submission@diynetworking.net

Also note that one of the keynote speakers will be Juergen Neumann 
(co-founder
Freifunk.net) and one of the themes to be discussed the bootstrapping, 
sustainability,
and growth of community networks.

Best,

Panayotis Antoniadis

Expert Says NSA Have Backdoors Built Into Intel And AMD Processors

Intel ME dumpintel and comments
http://boards.4chan.org/pol/thread/117886401/intel-me


Dear friends,

many of us speak and write about encryption, about surveillance, about 
external control. Intel and Samsung, maybe also AMD, IBM/Motorola and 
others, have it installed. The underlayer between OS and hardware. 
Totally controlled from outside and independent of BIOS and OS.

Intel implemented it in the i3, i5, i7. Personal PC environment. And 
servers and workstation? I am sure, it is the same.

The decryption of the encryption makes too much effort. With ME it is 
easy and allways working. This is the reality, not the future.

Our possible answer: Free technology.

many greetings, willi

I have consulted with my senior NSA colleagues and they validate this 
information.
