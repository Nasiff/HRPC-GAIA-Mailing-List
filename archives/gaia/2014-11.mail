That's good news for an open internet which needs more bandwidth.
The bill talked about taxing *per gigaByte* if I read correctly.

Flexible pricing has to be carefully defined. Flexible pricing and "pay ext=
ra for more" already exists in a sense, considering that you can pay more a=
nd have fibre (and you get faster internet), or more data allowance on your=
 (mobile) contract (and you get more data). Even as a content provider you =
pay more and get your data to a more expensive CDN with a larger footprint.

The comparison of the internet to the transport network, where people using=
 the network during peak times have to pay more is a rather misleading case=
 IMO. The London tube network is a good example here to show that this is n=
ot working (I guess the situation is similar elsewhere). Commuters pay more=
 (sometimes up to 30% more) during peak hours (6-9.30am and 4-7pm). During =
rush hour, trains run every minute (I guess you physically can=92t have mor=
e frequent service), but still all stations, platforms and trains are compl=
etely jam packed (at least for some part of the peak period).

The takeaway is that if the system is operating at full capacity, paying mo=
re is just a rip-off charge which does not solve any problem. If people hav=
e to be in their office on time because otherwise they=92ll lose their job,=
 but can=92t go two hours earlier (to avoid congestion and charges) because=
 they=92ve got kids to take care of, then charging them more is not a very =
reasonable approach. Even if some don=92t care about the extra charge, they=
 certainly don=92t have more fun being squeezed like sardines during their =
commute. Although for the London tube network there might not be a solution=
 to the congestion problem (because variable pricing is not solving anythin=
g), it=92s a shame to say that there=92s nothing we can do for the Internet=
 to be more efficient and cheaper!!

Maybe thinking the other way round would be a better fit: the bus-lane road=
 network might be a better example, where people who pay more (and have car=
s) are normally stuck in traffic (in the congested part of the network) and=
 see people who can=92t afford a car and jump on the bus moving faster! :) =
So, prioritisation here might need to come in terms of giving priority to t=
he slow users, because fibre ones (normally) have fast service anyway. Star=
tups like MUBI and Spotify need the people =93on the bus=94 to succeed! Tho=
se "on cars" can go and buy the music/films they want anyway straight from =
the producer..

Yiannis.

Hi Michael and Richard,=20

Thanks for your support. Any technical literature on scalable successful =
BoP networks would be most helpful. I am also trying to find the =
detailed network architecture and business plans of Kansas =
City=E2=80=99s Rosedale Ridge Wi-Fi network =E2=80=93 I think practical =
examples are more likely to trigger the interest needed for large scale =
development, for now interest is dominated by bottom lines and big =
tenders. Sadly, South Africa=E2=80=99s innovation remains small scale =
unless the =E2=80=9CBig 3=E2=80=9D (MTN, Telkom, Vodacom) take an =
interest, and usually end up blowing all social development =
opportunities in the process.  =E2=80=A6

Hi Michael,

=20

Thanks, this is very interesting. Are you able to access details of the =
wireless network architecture they used? This will help me greatly in an =
attempt I have embarked on to connect rural enclaves in South Africa. =
The gist of my attempt is based around a response to ICASA=E2=80=99s IMT =
Roadmap public consultations that are in progress. I zeroed in on the =
IMT 450 MHz spectrum band that now of our major operators are interested =
in (only 20 MHz available). I attach a response to questions raised by =
ICASA for information on what I have proposed, but please keep this =
somewhat confidential for now =E2=80=93 it is a work in progress.

=20

A similar example from other countries should trigger greater interest =
by ICASA and the ministry.

=20

Thanks,

Walter.

Here's a story about rural community initiative.    RL

=20

=20

Community Comes Together to Bring High-Speed Internet to Remote Colorado =
Town
=20
If too many people at this town's school used computers simultaneously, =
the previous Internet system timed out and reverted to the speed of a =
dial-up connection -- but that is no longer the case.
=20
by Debbie Kelley, The Gazette (TNS) / October 27, 2014
=20
http://www.govtech.com/network/Community-Comes-Together-to-Bring-high-spe=
ed-Internet-to-remote-mountain-town.html=20
=20
There's no gas station in the remote mountain town of Guffey, about 60 =
miles west of Colorado Springs, but there is a post office with 420 =
boxes, a library, a school, an auto repair shop, three restaurants and =
now, high-speed Internet for all.
=20
"It's huge," said resident Kim McAlear.
=20
Life hasn't exactly been stuck in the Stone Age, but some say it was =
close. Or at least, not the 21st century.
=20
Previously, if too many people used computers at the same time the =
rudimentary satellite system that provided Internet timed out and =
reverted to the speed of a dial-up connection for the 39 students at the =
Guffey Community Charter School.
=20
The setup was so antiquated that to take required state standardized =
tests, students had to be bused 55 miles to Fairplay, which everyone =
says made for a harrowing trip if there was snow.
=20
Nearly a year ago, leaders at the Guffey Community Charter School =
decided enough was enough. When a 20-acre parcel of hilly land east of =
the school became available last November, principal and administrator =
Pam Moore figured it was time to rally the troops.
=20
And that's the story within this story. The pioneering spirit of the =
community produced a gung-ho push that raised $55,000. Grants came =
through from the Park County Conservation Trust Fund, El Pomar =
Foundation and the Cripple Creek and Victor Gold Mining Co. A local =
rancher pitched in $5,000.
=20
Students in the K-8 public charter school did fundraisers, such as =
making their popular fire-starter cups out of sawdust and paraffin wax.
=20
And, then, Moore said, small donations of $10, $25 and $50 trickled in.
=20
"The town is rural, and the folks that live here are doing their best, =
and we had a lot of those small donations that were really meaningful =
because people work really hard to get that kind of money," she said.
=20
The donations bought the $40,000 piece of land, which the school =
acquired in February from a private resident, and solar technology to =
power the equipment. A $15,000 anonymous donation paid for 20 new =
computers.
=20
The school had a huge satellite dish in front of it when it opened in =
1999 and has tried to keep up with technology, Moore said, but "we came =
to a point where we were totally limited as far as the next steps."
=20
Previous attempts to bring high-speed Internet connectivity to the area =
failed, due to the lack of a direct line of sight to a =
telecommunications tower and service providers' unwillingness to find a =
way to make it work.
=20
South Park Telephone Co., which is based in Hartsel and specializes in =
rural customers, agreed to expand its services to Guffey and built a =
tower and solar shed to house the equipment on the highest point of the =
land the school bought. A local excavator groomed the road. Park County =
helped with permitting and other site particulars.
=20
"At the end of the day, voila, they are in the 21st century, and this is =
the way it should be done," said David Shipley, business manager for =
South Park Telephone Co.
=20
The system went live in mid-August, right before school started for the =
year. So far, so good.
=20
"We wanted to make sure we were able to provide it for the school and =
not jeopardize the bandwidth before we started selling it to the =
public," Shipley said.
=20
On Oct. 1, the company allowed residents to sign up for high-speed =
Internet service.
=20
"We've had a fantastic response," he said.
=20
Still, it's a gamble for the company.
=20
"From a return on investment, the numbers just don't work. But some =
things we do in life can't be all about the money, it's got to be about =
doing the right thing," Shipley said. "This was one of those projects =
where there were no hidden agendas. Everybody's agenda was the same - =
get the project done."
=20
The benefit for students is worth every penny, Moore said.
=20
"Kids are delighted to have an opportunity to learn like all other kids =
in more urban environments," she said. "The things that some kids take =
for granted our kids cherish because we have families that don't have =
television and can't afford to purchase Internet service. So the school =
has become the hub of the community."
=20
McAlear, who has two students at Guffey Community Charter School, said =
she cried at the recent ribbon cutting ceremony at the tower high above =
the town.
=20
"We live out here because we want to, but there are definite drawbacks. =
Our kids not having access to the educational resources that other kids =
have is one of the big ones," she said.
=20
"The fact that it's not an issue anymore is amazing. It's such a big =
heart for such a small community."

state&nbsp;standardized tests, students had to be bused 55 miles to =
Fairplay,&nbsp;which&nbsp;everyone says made for a harrowing trip if =
there was snow.<br>&nbsp;<br>Nearly a year ago, leaders at the Guffey =
Community Charter&nbsp;School decided enough was enough. When a 20-acre =
parcel of&nbsp;hilly land east of&nbsp;the school became available last =
November, principal and administrator Pam&nbsp;Moore figured it was time =
to&nbsp;rally the troops.<br>&nbsp;<br>And that's the story within this =
story. The pioneering&nbsp;spirit of the community produced a gung-ho =
push that raised $55,000.&nbsp;Grants&nbsp;came through from the Park =
County Conservation Trust Fund, El Pomar Foundation&nbsp;and the Cripple =
Creek and&nbsp;Victor Gold Mining Co. A local rancher pitched =
in&nbsp;$5,000.<br>&nbsp;<br>Students in the K-8 public charter school =
did fundraisers,&nbsp;such as making their popular fire-starter cups out =
of sawdust and&nbsp;paraffin wax.<br>&nbsp;<br>And, then, Moore said, =
small donations of $10, $25 and $50&nbsp;trickled =
in.<br>&nbsp;<br>&quot;The town is rural, and the folks that live here =
are&nbsp;doing their best, and we had a lot of those small donations =
that were really&nbsp;meaningful because people work really hard to get =
that kind of money,&quot; she&nbsp;said.<br>&nbsp;<br>The donations =
bought the $40,000 piece of land, which the&nbsp;school acquired in =
February from a private resident, and solar&nbsp;technology =
to&nbsp;power the equipment. A $15,000 anonymous donation paid for 20 =
new computers.<br>&nbsp;<br>The school had a huge satellite dish in =
front of it when it&nbsp;opened in 1999 and has tried to keep up with =
technology, Moore&nbsp;said, but&nbsp;&quot;we came to a point where we =
were totally limited as far as the =
next&nbsp;steps.&quot;<br>&nbsp;<br>Previous attempts to bring =
high-speed Internet connectivity&nbsp;to the area failed, due to the =
lack of a direct line of sight to a&nbsp;telecommunications tower and =
service providers' unwillingness to find a way to&nbsp;make it =
work.<br>&nbsp;<br>South Park Telephone Co., which is based in Hartsel =
and&nbsp;specializes in rural customers, agreed to expand its services =
to&nbsp;Guffey and&nbsp;built a tower and solar shed to house the =
equipment on the highest point of the&nbsp;land the school bought. A =
local&nbsp;excavator groomed the road. Park County helped&nbsp;with =
permitting and other site particulars.<br>&nbsp;<br>&quot;At the end of =
the day, voila, they are in the 21st&nbsp;century, and this is the way =
it should be done,&quot; said David Shipley,&nbsp;business manager for =
South Park Telephone Co.<br>&nbsp;<br>The system went live in =
mid-August, right before school&nbsp;started for the year. So far, so =
good.<br>&nbsp;<br>&quot;We wanted to make sure we were able to provide =

for&nbsp;high-speed Internet service.<br>&nbsp;<br>&quot;We've had a =
fantastic response,&quot; he said.<br>&nbsp;<br>Still, it's a gamble for =
the company.<br>&nbsp;<br>&quot;From a return on investment, the numbers =
just don't&nbsp;work. But some things we do in life can't be all about =
the money, it's&nbsp;got to&nbsp;be about doing the right thing,&quot; =
Shipley said. &quot;This was one of those&nbsp;projects where there were =
no hidden agendas.&nbsp;Everybody's agenda was the same -&nbsp;get the =
project done.&quot;<br>&nbsp;<br>The benefit for students is worth every =
penny, Moore said.<br>&nbsp;<br>&quot;Kids are delighted to have an =
opportunity to learn&nbsp;like all other kids in more urban =
environments,&quot; she said. &quot;The&nbsp;things that&nbsp;some kids =
take for granted our kids cherish because we have&nbsp;families that =
don't have television and can't afford to =
purchase&nbsp;Internet&nbsp;service. So the school has become the hub of =
the community.&quot;<br>&nbsp;<br>McAlear, who has two students at =

ribbon cutting ceremony&nbsp;at the tower high&nbsp;above the =
town.<br>&nbsp;<br>&quot;We live out here because we want to, but there =
are&nbsp;definite drawbacks. Our kids not having access to the =
educational&nbsp;resources&nbsp;that other kids have is one of the big =
ones,&quot; she said.<br>&nbsp;<br>&quot;The fact that it's not an issue =
anymore is amazing.&nbsp;It's such a big heart for such a small =

Hi, one example in South Africa is reported here:

Carlos Rey-Moreno, Zukile Roro, William D. Tucker, Masbulele Jay Siya, =
Nicola J. Bidwell, and Javier Simo-Reigadas. 2013. Experiences, =
challenges and lessons from rolling out a rural WiFi mesh network. In =
Proceedings of the 3rd ACM Symposium on Computing for Development (ACM =
DEV '13). ACM, New York, NY, USA, , Article 11 , 10 pages. =
DOI=3D10.1145/2442882.2442897 http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2442882.2442897 =
<http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2442882.2442897>

A web site: http://villagetelco.org/deployments/mankosi-south-africa/ =
<http://villagetelco.org/deployments/mankosi-south-africa/>
The project is very active and recently they organised a workshop: =
http://nicbidwell.me/participatory-networks-event/ =
<http://nicbidwell.me/participatory-networks-event/>
Carlos and William are the main contacts. They use the villagetelco.org =
MeshPotato open hw/hw, particularly adequate for that environment.

Regarding larger networks, the largest example I know is guifi.net =
<http://guifi.net/> (now 26K active nodes) with a combination of wifi =
and fibre deployments mostly in Spain. More related papers in =

> =20

close. Or at least, not the 21st century.

rudimentary satellite system that provided Internet timed out and =
reverted to the speed of a dial-up connection for the 39 students at the =
Guffey Community Charter School.
> =20
> The setup was so antiquated that to take required state standardized =
tests, students had to be bused 55 miles to Fairplay, which everyone =
says made for a harrowing trip if there was snow.
> =20
> Nearly a year ago, leaders at the Guffey Community Charter School =
decided enough was enough. When a 20-acre parcel of hilly land east of =
the school became available last November, principal and administrator =
Pam Moore figured it was time to rally the troops.
> =20
> And that's the story within this story. The pioneering spirit of the =
community produced a gung-ho push that raised $55,000. Grants came =
through from the Park County Conservation Trust Fund, El Pomar =
Foundation and the Cripple Creek and Victor Gold Mining Co. A local =
rancher pitched in $5,000.
> =20
> Students in the K-8 public charter school did fundraisers, such as =
making their popular fire-starter cups out of sawdust and paraffin wax.
> =20
> And, then, Moore said, small donations of $10, $25 and $50 trickled =
in.
> =20
> "The town is rural, and the folks that live here are doing their best, =
and we had a lot of those small donations that were really meaningful =
because people work really hard to get that kind of money," she said.
> =20
> The donations bought the $40,000 piece of land, which the school =
acquired in February from a private resident, and solar technology to =
power the equipment. A $15,000 anonymous donation paid for 20 new =
computers.
> =20
> The school had a huge satellite dish in front of it when it opened in =
1999 and has tried to keep up with technology, Moore said, but "we came =
to a point where we were totally limited as far as the next steps."
> =20
> Previous attempts to bring high-speed Internet connectivity to the =
area failed, due to the lack of a direct line of sight to a =
telecommunications tower and service providers' unwillingness to find a =
way to make it work.
> =20
> South Park Telephone Co., which is based in Hartsel and specializes in =
rural customers, agreed to expand its services to Guffey and built a =
tower and solar shed to house the equipment on the highest point of the =
land the school bought. A local excavator groomed the road. Park County =
helped with permitting and other site particulars.
> =20
> "At the end of the day, voila, they are in the 21st century, and this =
is the way it should be done," said David Shipley, business manager for =
South Park Telephone Co.
> =20
> The system went live in mid-August, right before school started for =
the year. So far, so good.
> =20
> "We wanted to make sure we were able to provide it for the school and =
not jeopardize the bandwidth before we started selling it to the =
public," Shipley said.
> =20

Internet service.
> =20

> "=46rom a return on investment, the numbers just don't work. But some =
things we do in life can't be all about the money, it's got to be about =
doing the right thing," Shipley said. "This was one of those projects =
where there were no hidden agendas. Everybody's agenda was the same - =
get the project done."
> =20
> The benefit for students is worth every penny, Moore said.

kids in more urban environments," she said. "The things that some kids =
take for granted our kids cherish because we have families that don't =
have television and can't afford to purchase Internet service. So the =
school has become the hub of the community."

the town.

All,

Further to our recent discussions on smart data pricing, we (Gareth,
Soumya and I) are conducting a research study to better understand how
innovative pricing models for "data" can help bring Internet access to
the millions of people in the world who have so far been left
disconnected. We wish to ask several questions about how pricing
models for "data" would be most attractive to network operators, as
well as the challenges that might come with them.

We would appreciate if this can be filled by the network operators,
VNOs, the community wireless network operators etc in the mailing
list. Incase you know of any other NOs, could you please forward this
to them. The deadline for filling the form is November 12th. It will
be great to get the survey done by many NOs as possible for us to
decipher the benefits of SDP on enabling affordable Internet access.

The questionnaire should take no longer than 10 minutes, and all data
will be anonymous, private and exclusively used for non-commercial
purposes. We will be presenting the results to GAIA.

The survey is here:
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1B-Vtl3mYJ2TJMWiFXxHySMrKSqxrhy0EzVNDlXKhPew/viewform

Regards
Arjuna Sathiaseelan, Gareth Tyson and Soumya Sen

Hi,
besides the pointers already provided, and considering that the requirement
is to deploy in the 450 MHz band which had several deployments using CDMA
450 a few years back.
The one in COTECAL http://cotecal.com.ar/telefonia-cdma/ is still working,
AFAIK. They were providing phone service and low speed data since the
allocated bandwidth was only 5 MHz, but they had some clients 50 km away
from the base station.

Currently there is a lot of interest in TV White Spaces technology, and
equipment is becoming available from several manufactures. Most will offer
gear that covers the 470 to 690 MHz band, and use channels up to 8 MHz
wide, but eventually channel bonding could be applied to take advantage of
the 20 MHz available.

Doodle Labs from Singapore manufacture radio cards that work at 450 MHz and
can use up to 20 MHz channel bandwidth, but they have to be housed in
boards like those manufactured by Mikrotik or Alix.

Regards,
Ermanno

here is a post=C2=A0office=C2=A0with 420 boxes, a library, a school, an aut=
o repair shop, three restaurants and=C2=A0now, high-speed Internet for all.=
<br>=C2=A0<br>&quot;It&#39;s huge,&quot; said resident Kim McAlear.<br>=C2=
=A0<br>Life hasn&#39;t exactly been stuck in the Stone Age, but some=C2=A0s=
ay it was close. Or at least, not the 21st century.<br>=C2=A0<br>Previously=
, if too many people used computers at the same=C2=A0time the rudimentary s=
atellite system that provided Internet timed=C2=A0out and=C2=A0reverted to =
the speed of a dial-up connection for the 39 students at the Guffey=C2=A0Co=
mmunity Charter School.<br>=C2=A0<br>The setup was so antiquated that to ta=
ke required state=C2=A0standardized tests, students had to be bused 55 mile=
s to Fairplay,=C2=A0which=C2=A0everyone says made for a harrowing trip if t=
here was snow.<br>=C2=A0<br>Nearly a year ago, leaders at the Guffey Commun=
ity Charter=C2=A0School decided enough was enough. When a 20-acre parcel of=
=C2=A0hilly land east of=C2=A0the school became available last November, pr=
incipal and administrator Pam=C2=A0Moore figured it was time to=C2=A0rally =
the troops.<br>=C2=A0<br>And that&#39;s the story within this story. The pi=
oneering=C2=A0spirit of the community produced a gung-ho push that raised $=
55,000.=C2=A0Grants=C2=A0came through from the Park County Conservation Tru=
st Fund, El Pomar Foundation=C2=A0and the Cripple Creek and=C2=A0Victor Gol=
d Mining Co. A local rancher pitched in=C2=A0$5,000.<br>=C2=A0<br>Students =
in the K-8 public charter school did fundraisers,=C2=A0such as making their=
 popular fire-starter cups out of sawdust and=C2=A0paraffin wax.<br>=C2=A0<=
br>And, then, Moore said, small donations of $10, $25 and $50=C2=A0trickled=
 in.<br>=C2=A0<br>&quot;The town is rural, and the folks that live here are=
=C2=A0doing their best, and we had a lot of those small donations that were=
 really=C2=A0meaningful because people work really hard to get that kind of=
 money,&quot; she=C2=A0said.<br>=C2=A0<br>The donations bought the $40,000 =
piece of land, which the=C2=A0school acquired in February from a private re=
sident, and solar=C2=A0technology to=C2=A0power the equipment. A $15,000 an=
onymous donation paid for 20 new computers.<br>=C2=A0<br>The school had a h=
uge satellite dish in front of it when it=C2=A0opened in 1999 and has tried=
 to keep up with technology, Moore=C2=A0said, but=C2=A0&quot;we came to a p=
oint where we were totally limited as far as the next=C2=A0steps.&quot;<br>=
=C2=A0<br>Previous attempts to bring high-speed Internet connectivity=C2=A0=
to the area failed, due to the lack of a direct line of sight to a=C2=A0tel=
ecommunications tower and service providers&#39; unwillingness to find a wa=
y to=C2=A0make it work.<br>=C2=A0<br>South Park Telephone Co., which is bas=
ed in Hartsel and=C2=A0specializes in rural customers, agreed to expand its=
 services to=C2=A0Guffey and=C2=A0built a tower and solar shed to house the=
 equipment on the highest point of the=C2=A0land the school bought. A local=
=C2=A0excavator groomed the road. Park County helped=C2=A0with permitting a=
nd other site particulars.<br>=C2=A0<br>&quot;At the end of the day, voila,=
 they are in the 21st=C2=A0century, and this is the way it should be done,&=
quot; said David Shipley,=C2=A0business manager for South Park Telephone Co=
.<br>=C2=A0<br>The system went live in mid-August, right before school=C2=
=A0started for the year. So far, so good.<br>=C2=A0<br>&quot;We wanted to m=
ake sure we were able to provide it for=C2=A0the school and not jeopardize =
the bandwidth before we started=C2=A0selling it to the=C2=A0public,&quot; S=
hipley said.<br>=C2=A0<br>On Oct. 1, the company allowed residents to sign =
up for=C2=A0high-speed Internet service.<br>=C2=A0<br>&quot;We&#39;ve had a=
 fantastic response,&quot; he said.<br>=C2=A0<br>Still, it&#39;s a gamble f=
or the company.<br>=C2=A0<br>&quot;From a return on investment, the numbers=
 just don&#39;t=C2=A0work. But some things we do in life can&#39;t be all a=
bout the money, it&#39;s=C2=A0got to=C2=A0be about doing the right thing,&q=
uot; Shipley said. &quot;This was one of those=C2=A0projects where there we=
re no hidden agendas.=C2=A0Everybody&#39;s agenda was the same -=C2=A0get t=
he project done.&quot;<br>=C2=A0<br>The benefit for students is worth every=
 penny, Moore said.<br>=C2=A0<br>&quot;Kids are delighted to have an opport=
unity to learn=C2=A0like all other kids in more urban environments,&quot; s=
he said. &quot;The=C2=A0things that=C2=A0some kids take for granted our kid=
s cherish because we have=C2=A0families that don&#39;t have television and =
can&#39;t afford to purchase=C2=A0Internet=C2=A0service. So the school has =
become the hub of the community.&quot;<br>=C2=A0<br>McAlear, who has two st=

=C2=A0<br>&quot;We live out here because we want to, but there are=C2=A0def=
inite drawbacks. Our kids not having access to the educational=C2=A0resourc=

Hi all,

South Africa is a great place to pursue dynamic spectrum (tv white spaces)
as the regulator is fairly close to producing regulation on dynamic
spectrum use.  You can seen the results of the trials that began in 2012 at
http://www.tenet.ac.za/tvws

Another interesting initiative is Project Isiswe (http://projectisizwe.org/=
)
which is rolling out municipal WiFi projects in South Africa.  They are
currently in Stellenbosch and Pretoria I believe.

The government of the Western Cape has plans to roll out WiFi mesh networks
to several townships in the province -
http://www.politicsweb.co.za/politicsweb/view/politicsweb/en/page71619?oid=
=3D591454&sn=3DMarketingweb+detail

No one currently, to my knowledge, has a CDMA 450MHz license in South
Africa  and I have never seen it mentioned on the list of priority spectrum
for the regulator.  Their current priorities for spectrum release are in
the 700MHz, 800MHz, and 2.6GHz bands.

Further to Leandro's suggestion regarding the network in Mankosi, here is a
link to a recently completed master's thesis looking at the network from a
community informatics and sustainability perspective
http://www.danfowler.net/resources/dissertation.pdf  One of the most
interesting things about this network is the fact that they are a
telecommunications cooperative formed under South Africas, recently-passed
and quite progressive cooperative legislation.  They were recently granted
license-exempt status by the regulator.  Full disclosure: I am the founder
of Village Telco.

Cheers... Steve

=C2=A0<br>Previously, if too many people used computers at the same=C2=A0ti=
me the rudimentary satellite system that provided Internet timed=C2=A0out a=
nd=C2=A0reverted to the speed of a dial-up connection for the 39 students a=
t the Guffey=C2=A0Community Charter School.<br>=C2=A0<br>The setup was so a=
ntiquated that to take required state=C2=A0standardized tests, students had=
 to be bused 55 miles to Fairplay,=C2=A0which=C2=A0everyone says made for a=
 harrowing trip if there was snow.<br>=C2=A0<br>Nearly a year ago, leaders =
at the Guffey Community Charter=C2=A0School decided enough was enough. When=
 a 20-acre parcel of=C2=A0hilly land east of=C2=A0the school became availab=
le last November, principal and administrator Pam=C2=A0Moore figured it was=
 time to=C2=A0rally the troops.<br>=C2=A0<br>And that&#39;s the story withi=
n this story. The pioneering=C2=A0spirit of the community produced a gung-h=
o push that raised $55,000.=C2=A0Grants=C2=A0came through from the Park Cou=
nty Conservation Trust Fund, El Pomar Foundation=C2=A0and the Cripple Creek=
 and=C2=A0Victor Gold Mining Co. A local rancher pitched in=C2=A0$5,000.<br=
>=C2=A0<br>Students in the K-8 public charter school did fundraisers,=C2=A0=
such as making their popular fire-starter cups out of sawdust and=C2=A0para=
ffin wax.<br>=C2=A0<br>And, then, Moore said, small donations of $10, $25 a=
nd $50=C2=A0trickled in.<br>=C2=A0<br>&quot;The town is rural, and the folk=
s that live here are=C2=A0doing their best, and we had a lot of those small=
 donations that were really=C2=A0meaningful because people work really hard=
 to get that kind of money,&quot; she=C2=A0said.<br>=C2=A0<br>The donations=
 bought the $40,000 piece of land, which the=C2=A0school acquired in Februa=
ry from a private resident, and solar=C2=A0technology to=C2=A0power the equ=
ipment. A $15,000 anonymous donation paid for 20 new computers.<br>=C2=A0<b=
r>The school had a huge satellite dish in front of it when it=C2=A0opened i=
n 1999 and has tried to keep up with technology, Moore=C2=A0said, but=C2=A0=
&quot;we came to a point where we were totally limited as far as the next=
=C2=A0steps.&quot;<br>=C2=A0<br>Previous attempts to bring high-speed Inter=
net connectivity=C2=A0to the area failed, due to the lack of a direct line =
of sight to a=C2=A0telecommunications tower and service providers&#39; unwi=
llingness to find a way to=C2=A0make it work.<br>=C2=A0<br>South Park Telep=
hone Co., which is based in Hartsel and=C2=A0specializes in rural customers=
, agreed to expand its services to=C2=A0Guffey and=C2=A0built a tower and s=
olar shed to house the equipment on the highest point of the=C2=A0land the =
school bought. A local=C2=A0excavator groomed the road. Park County helped=
=C2=A0with permitting and other site particulars.<br>=C2=A0<br>&quot;At the=
 end of the day, voila, they are in the 21st=C2=A0century, and this is the =
way it should be done,&quot; said David Shipley,=C2=A0business manager for =
South Park Telephone Co.<br>=C2=A0<br>The system went live in mid-August, r=
ight before school=C2=A0started for the year. So far, so good.<br>=C2=A0<br=
>&quot;We wanted to make sure we were able to provide it for=C2=A0the schoo=
l and not jeopardize the bandwidth before we started=C2=A0selling it to the=
=C2=A0public,&quot; Shipley said.<br>=C2=A0<br>On Oct. 1, the company allow=
ed residents to sign up for=C2=A0high-speed Internet service.<br>=C2=A0<br>=
&quot;We&#39;ve had a fantastic response,&quot; he said.<br>=C2=A0<br>Still=
, it&#39;s a gamble for the company.<br>=C2=A0<br>&quot;From a return on in=
vestment, the numbers just don&#39;t=C2=A0work. But some things we do in li=
fe can&#39;t be all about the money, it&#39;s=C2=A0got to=C2=A0be about doi=
ng the right thing,&quot; Shipley said. &quot;This was one of those=C2=A0pr=
ojects where there were no hidden agendas.=C2=A0Everybody&#39;s agenda was =
the same -=C2=A0get the project done.&quot;<br>=C2=A0<br>The benefit for st=
udents is worth every penny, Moore said.<br>=C2=A0<br>&quot;Kids are deligh=
ted to have an opportunity to learn=C2=A0like all other kids in more urban =
environments,&quot; she said. &quot;The=C2=A0things that=C2=A0some kids tak=
e for granted our kids cherish because we have=C2=A0families that don&#39;t=
 have television and can&#39;t afford to purchase=C2=A0Internet=C2=A0servic=
e. So the school has become the hub of the community.&quot;<br>=C2=A0<br>Mc=
Alear, who has two students at Guffey Community Charter=C2=A0School, said s=
he cried at the recent ribbon cutting ceremony=C2=A0at the tower high=C2=A0=
above the town.<br>=C2=A0<br>&quot;We live out here because we want to, but=
 there are=C2=A0definite drawbacks. Our kids not having access to the educa=
tional=C2=A0resources=C2=A0that other kids have is one of the big ones,&quo=
t; she said.<br>=C2=A0<br>&quot;The fact that it&#39;s not an issue anymore=
 is amazing.=C2=A0It&#39;s such a big heart for such a small community.&quo=

Thanks Lars - thats a great idea. We were planning to email the
RIPE/NANOG lists - but will also do for the irtf/ietf-discuss too.
Thanks

Regards

Arjuna,

I'm not currently a network operator although I spent some time
in the middle of the sorts of decisions you are concerned about
(see below).  I am, or have recently, consulted with a few on
issues close to these and can, perhaps, provide some useful
insight and free advice.

First, much of the information you are asking for in the survey
is considered strategic and _extremely_ sensitive.  The
situation would be different in some small ISPs and network
operators, but, especially in the larger ones, these kinds of
strategic considerations are compartmentalized off from the
people in the company who actually operate the networks,
discussed on a "need to know" basis, and kept away from both
researchers and regulators and especially from competitors.  In
your particular case and given Google's involvement in community
fiber experiment and their terms of use allowing them to data
mine anything, putting the survey on a Google site would be
considered equivalent to handing it to a competitor.

So, while you might be some interesting results, I hope you
understand that you are likely to end up with a highly biased
cross section of the community.

Also, while I like your survey instrument in general, there are
a number of important models, including some variations of
services barter, that you have left out and that have
occasionally been proven useful in developing areas.  There are
also some new efforts to reinvent the old model of mini-IPSs
(see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvdFUIufwFE -- note English
subtitles are available).  That example project is focused in
very high speeds and high density urban areas, but the model of
very small area delivery ISPs (and other essentially bottom-up
aggregation arrangements) has been used effectively before in
developing areas.

If you have not already done so, I recommend that you talk with
Steve Huter at NRSC (link below) and/or with Randy Bush about
existing models in Least Developed Areas that you might not have
on your radar.  Steve might even be useful to recruit into the
RG if he can make the time available.  You can tell him I
recommended that you contact him.

Good luck.  Let me know if I can be of help.  And feel free to
circulate any parts of this note that would be helpful to the
GAIA mailing list.

Hi Michael and everyone,

 

Michael, thanks for circulating this discussion, and everyone for
responding. I have some reservations about too much publicity, perhaps
misplaced, but I think the decision-making culture in South Africa today
does not like publicity - in fact, we are trying to control this also
through worrying national policy developments. I hope I am wrong but this is
the reason for limiting my response to those helpful colleagues that
responded directly.

 

Let me respond to some of the issues raised, especially by Fred.

 

The first explanation I must give is that I strongly believe that connecting
rural and other marginalised communities is not a technological challenge
whatsoever. We did this in the old POTS days with party line wired systems,
leaped on the technological bandwagon with technological tricks like carrier
derived party lines (up to 20 party lines on each of up to 18 carrier
channels like South Africa's SOR 18), individually metred party lines with
privacy developed in early Zimbabwe, MARS wireless systems that formed the
basis for Botswana's rural connectivity like SRT's offerings of the 1980s,
added main line drop/insert multiple line carrier systems, etc. All this
shows my age perhaps, but what has changed today? Why the big rural (and
poor urban) challenges when so many technological choices exist?

 

We all know that if we wanted to, we could extend DSL type services to tens
of kilometres on any form of copper loop using very low cost inline
repeaters/regenerators with serious drop/insert possibilities, and any mix
of wireless technologies including satellite and even 2/3G. There are
existing copper loops in very poor communities providing fixed line POTS
service to small businesses - what can we do with broadband on these
existing lines that do not require costly civil works? I must ask why
Nokia/Siemens' "Village Connection" failed so dismally, or even Steve's Mesh
Potato and/or Meraka's rural Wi-Fi Mesh, or worse still, Telkom's rural WLL
all failed? Those familiar with the South African scenario can suggest
simple answers, which don't address my feeling that collectively (that
includes us, the politicians and big business) we don't really want to
connect the information have-nots, much easier to pay lip services or to
tinker on the edges. We have enough combinations of technologies to connect
anyone anywhere, and cost-effectively too, if we want to enough.

 

Enough of the rant - thanks for listening... Now to points raised by Fred:

 

1.       What I intended by "scalable successful BoP networks" was to
describe any network architectures, or combinations thereof, that can scale
nationally to service the Bottom of the Pyramid market. The world is awash
with small successful pilot projects to prove this or that technology, or
great potential initiatives like Steve's Mesh Potato that offer great
possibilities, but remain in tiny enclaves while politicians write rousing
speeches about rural connectivity, and big business quietly sabotages such
initiatives to protect their bottom lines. Stories where the vast swathe of
obstacles have been overcome is what I am looking for, they can support the
argument for sanity very strongly (Einstein: insanity is doing the same
things over and over again and expecting different results);

2.       I agree and disagree with Fred on broadband power lines: I agree
that PLCs, BPL,s or any other acronym used to describe power lines as the
basic broadband  transport platform have promised much more than they could
deliver. There is one power line opportunity that does work, but has not
been used for the purpose we are discussing - fibre optic lines constructed
on existing overhead power lines of any voltage feeding or just passing
remote communities with a connectable POP. Fantastic opportunities to
backhaul any form of local wireless access. Apparently the management
challenges concerning this opportunity (who owns the infrastructure - power
utilities of ICT providers?) have trashed the whole idea;

3.       I will skip the opportunity to comment on South Africa's spectrum
issues, competition, liberalization, monopolies and small businesses. This
cold unemotional communication medium will not accurately transmit the
weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth that responds best to this
observation;

4.       We have a growing and invaluable community of wireless ISPs - the
WAPA group that I admire greatly, but they fail on scalability as defined
above. MBMS applications on any broadband wireless infrastructure, including
LTE, supported by decent backhaul, offers tremendous opportunities to
converge all broadcast and telecom (if we must fragment our industry) for
the benefit of marginalised communities. We need to invent BoP focussed
WISPS for Africa (please, no more acronyms like WISPS4RD..);

5.         Ubiquiti, MikroTik, Cambium seem to provide the answers to my
question, but I cannot offer them as successful examples to decision-makers
without knowing the details of their network architectures, business models,
and socioeconomic objectives, which must all be fine-tuned for the local
environment. The Guffey case is very interesting, from the perspective of
the barriers imposed by the original arrangements, and the opportunities
presented by the innovative new. Details would help greatly. Yet another
example I am trying to get details of is the Kansas City Rosedale Ridge
civil society development. This will help our troubled seriously
marginalized urban enclaves, those which host most of the 13 million South
Africans who try to live on ZAR 6 (US$ 0.5) per day, as identified by Oxfam
in its latest report on inequality in South Africa. Some resort to other
means of feeding their families, which generally generate great discomfort
in the other segments of the population;

6.       "If the government of South Africa were cooperative about both
spectrum and the right to provide service without jumping through hoops,
then the technology is ready": That indeed is the reason for this inquiry,
that and the desire to find easy ways for those that already hold vast
blocks of spectrum to think of ways of integrating the BoP communities into
their market plans, a change of heart and bottom lines. The technology has
been, is, and will always be ready. The human/political/commercial factors
are what we are trying to influence for good.

7.       Concerning the 450 MHz spectrum band I referred to in my original
communication, this arose because it could be made available fairly quickly
by our state regulator, and is of little interest to our dominant operators.
The idea I have proposed is to assign this to multiple small new entrants
which focus on remote rural communities in the first instance, use LTE TDD
as P2P and P2MP backhaul connections to enable spectrum reuse, and any small
cell technology in meshed or direct arrangements in the target areas. There
is more than enough equipment in the global market to make this possible.
The challenge is to convince the powers that be to release the spectrum for
that purpose, then to assign it to small business entrepreneurs, and help
them to develop the required competencies to deliver the services.

 

Thanks again everyone, I sincerely hope you will continue to help to build a
picture of what is possible through real living examples.

 

Kind regards,

 

Walter.

I'm not sure what he's referring to by "scalable successful BoP networks".
Broadband on Power?  That's failed technology, a frankly bad idea that
hasn't worked well and at best offered only limited capacity for a very
short distance.  A fundamental problem is that power lines aren't designed
as high-frequency transmission lines; they're optimized for 50-60 Hz, and
also act as antennas at higher frequencies.

South Africa however poses its own challenges, based on regulatory problems.
While the spectrum has been somewhat harmonized with other countries, it
still seems to have rules that protect incumbent monopolists against
competition, preventing small business from entering the ISP market.  If
this has been liberalized, however, then the technology exists. 

Wireless ISPs cover a large share of the rural American land mass.  They can
be built much more cheaply than mobile networks, though competitive LTE
equipment markets are reducing the gap, to a merely smaller number of orders
of magnitude. And of course LTE generally requires exclusively-licensed
spectrum, while WISP gear is designed to share the unlicensed bands. The one
thing that makes it difficult is forest, as trees block microwave signals.
The most promising technology for that is  TV White Space, which uses
470-700 MHz frequencies. The WISP business is thus bigger in the farm,
prairie and desert areas.

Ubiquiti (California-based) is the dominant player in the US market.  Their
product line is very broad and priced very well.  They have full FCC
approvals, including the very difficult Dynamic Frequency Selection - Radar
Detection (DFS) needed for the 5.25-5.725 GHz sub-bands.  But not on
everything; they've been trying to get their new lineup approved since
February and their Taiwan-based compliance department is having a hell of a
time with it.  EU approval is apparently easier. 

MikroTik (Latvia-based) is probably the leader in world markets. They make
very good cheap routers and firewalls; I use their SOHO APs at home and in
the office.  They have, however, largely given up trying to get past the FCC
on 5 GHz.  They have no DFS approvals, and have not even submitted anything
for easy ISM-band approval since July, including some new products.  The
rest of the world is their oyster; the US is just a small piece they can put
aside.  They under-price Ubiquiti.

Cambium (Chicago-based), spun off from Motorola, has new stuff priced to
compete with Ubiquiti, vs. their old Motorola pricing (order of magnitude
higher). It lacks the WiFi compatibility of Ubiquiti and MikroTik (they use
proprietary schemes among their own gear but can connect to WiFi devices if
you want) but has other useful features (mainly GPS sync).  I am not so
comfortable with Altai, a Chinese shop whose gear strikes me as obsolete and
overpriced (what WiFi was in the last decade).

Guffey is a difficult case.  Its incumbent telephone service apparently
comes from CLQwest in Cripple Creek, 28 miles away.  They're a Price Cap
Carrier, which means they don't get subsidies based on cost, and are allowed
to just maximize profit.  Hence they ignore remote places like Guffey, which
under the old rate-of-return rules were cross-subidized.  Hartsel is 27
(road) miles the other way, but an easier microwave shot if you relay from a
nearby peak. So apparently South Park Tel in Hartsel is making the shot.  I
would have thought it would go into the Universal Service Fund subsidy base,
but (I checked the disbursements) their USF money has gone way down lately
under the new rules, and the reverse auction for subsidies to serve unserved
Price Cap Carrier areas hasn't happened yet. So I don't see how they can
make money on this.  Perhaps South Park Tel is not building it the usual
high-cost ILEC way, and is trying to do it the low-cost WISP way.

If the government of South Africa were cooperative about both spectrum and
the right to provide service without jumping through hoops, then the
technology is ready.

Hi Walter,

 

I can't point you directly at BoP success stories, but I can suggest where
you might find people who can help. Look at the vendors who sell relevant
equipment and at their customer bases. The big names from my perspective are
Ubiquiti Networks and MikroTik, but that's because those two have bothered
to get some of the more complex US type-approvals for their equipment. You
should also look at Altai Technologies, Bitlomat and Deliberant who sell
globally but not much in the US.

 

Look at these vendors for case studies and white papers, but more
importantly look at their customer bases (e.g. look at their on-line forums
and register for their support networks). Here you will find community
networkers, entrepreneurs and others who are using this low-cost wireless
technology to build networks in all sorts of places around the globe.

 

I am currently using such technology to successfully compete with Verizon
and Comcast in downtown Boston, i.e. nowhere near the bottom of the pyramid,
but others on the email lists I frequent are building Internet access
networks in rural areas around the world, including specifically both urban
and rural areas in Africa.

Also, despite claims of excess interference at 2.4 & 5 GHz, with directional
antennas this equipment can be used in urban areas. We (netBlazr Inc.) are
doing so very successfully. When you are getting bandwidth to remote areas,
there is less or no interference.

 

Finally, this is not super complex stuff, but it's also not consumer
technology. If you don't have or can't afford professionals, you will need
to find enthusiasts and geeks to install and maintain the network. But any
bright motivated kid can learn this stuff.


Thanks,

Hi Michael and Richard, 

Thanks for your support. Any technical literature on scalable successful BoP
networks would be most helpful. I am also trying to find the detailed
network architecture and business plans of Kansas City's Rosedale Ridge
Wi-Fi network - I think practical examples are more likely to trigger the
interest needed for large scale development, for now interest is dominated
by bottom lines and big tenders. Sadly, South Africa's innovation remains
small scale unless the "Big 3" (MTN, Telkom, Vodacom) take an interest, and
usually end up blowing all social development opportunities in the process.
.

Regards,

Walter.

g to by &quot;scalable successful BoP networks&quot;.&nbsp; Broadband on Po=
wer?&nbsp; That's failed technology, a frankly bad idea that hasn't worked =
well and at best offered only limited capacity for a very short distance.&n=
bsp; A fundamental problem is that power lines aren't designed as high-freq=
uency transmission lines; they're optimized for 50-60 Hz, and also act as a=
ntennas at higher frequencies.<br><br>South Africa however poses its own ch=
allenges, based on regulatory problems.&nbsp; While the spectrum has been s=
omewhat harmonized with other countries, it still seems to have rules that =
protect incumbent monopolists against competition, preventing small busines=
s from entering the ISP market.&nbsp; If this has been liberalized, however=
, then the technology exists. <br><br>Wireless ISPs cover a large share of =
the rural American land mass.&nbsp; They can be built much more cheaply tha=
n mobile networks, though competitive LTE equipment markets are reducing th=
e gap, to a merely smaller number of orders of magnitude. And of course LTE=
 generally requires exclusively-licensed spectrum, while WISP gear is desig=
ned to share the unlicensed bands. The one thing that makes it difficult is=
 forest, as trees block microwave signals. The most promising technology fo=
r that is&nbsp; TV White Space, which uses 470-700 MHz frequencies. The WIS=
P business is thus bigger in the farm, prairie and desert areas.<br><br>Ubi=
quiti (California-based) is the dominant player in the US market.&nbsp; The=
ir product line is very broad and priced very well.&nbsp; They have full FC=
C approvals, including the very difficult Dynamic Frequency Selection - Rad=
ar Detection (DFS) needed for the 5.25-5.725 GHz sub-bands.&nbsp; But not o=
n everything; they've been trying to get their new lineup approved since Fe=
bruary and their Taiwan-based compliance department is having a hell of a t=
ime with it.&nbsp; EU approval is apparently easier. <br><br>MikroTik (Latv=
ia-based) is probably the leader in world markets. They make very good chea=
p routers and firewalls; I use their SOHO APs at home and in the office.&nb=
sp; They have, however, largely given up trying to get past the FCC on 5 GH=
z.&nbsp; They have no DFS approvals, and have not even submitted anything f=
or easy ISM-band approval since July, including some new products.&nbsp; Th=
e rest of the world is their oyster; the US is just a small piece they can =
put aside.&nbsp; They under-price Ubiquiti.<br><br>Cambium (Chicago-based),=
 spun off from Motorola, has new stuff priced to compete with Ubiquiti, vs.=
 their old Motorola pricing (order of magnitude higher). It lacks the WiFi =
compatibility of Ubiquiti and MikroTik (they use proprietary schemes among =
their own gear but can connect to WiFi devices if you want) but has other u=
seful features (mainly GPS sync).&nbsp; I am not so comfortable with Altai,=
 a Chinese shop whose gear strikes me as obsolete and overpriced (what WiFi=
 was in the last decade).<br><br>Guffey is a difficult case.&nbsp; Its incu=
mbent telephone service apparently comes from CLQwest in Cripple Creek, 28 =
miles away.&nbsp; They're a Price Cap Carrier, which means they don't get s=
ubsidies based on cost, and are allowed to just maximize profit.&nbsp; Henc=
e they ignore remote places like Guffey, which under the old rate-of-return=
 rules were cross-subidized.&nbsp; Hartsel is 27 (road) miles the other way=
, but an easier microwave shot if you relay from a nearby peak. So apparent=
ly South Park Tel in Hartsel is making the shot.&nbsp; I would have thought=
 it would go into the Universal Service Fund subsidy base, but (I checked t=
he disbursements) their USF money has gone way down lately under the new ru=
les, and the reverse auction for subsidies to serve unserved Price Cap Carr=
ier areas hasn't happened yet. So I don't see how they can make money on th=
is.&nbsp; Perhaps South Park Tel is not building it the usual high-cost ILE=
C way, and is trying to do it the low-cost WISP way.<br><br>If the governme=
nt of South Africa were cooperative about both spectrum and the right to pr=
ovide service without jumping through hoops, then the technology is ready.<=

All,
 I am currently at the Abdus Salam International Centre for
Theoretical Physics (ICTP) visiting Marco Zennaro and Ermanno
Pietrosemoli.

Marco and Ermanno have been taking me around their lab showing some of
their testbeds which include low cost TVWS client nodes that use
cognitive spectrum sensing rather than a geolocation database as rural
areas have enough spectrum (we have an ACM DEV poster together on
this: http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~as2330/docs/dev204-zennaroA.pdf) as
well as Software Defined Radio boards (with OpenBTS capability) etc..

I am excited by the limitless opportunities provided by these
technologies and suggested to Marco, whether we could assemble a GAIA
demo based workshop (with tutorials) focussed on localised
communication platforms next summer to demonstrate these technologies
and educate the rest of the GAIA community. We could also tie in some
of Joerg Ott's liberouter work and if he is interested, we could have
an opportunistic router platform demo + tutorial too along with these.

Possibly a three day workshop and we could mobilise funds/grants from
different venues to support attendance from developing regions..

Would this be of any interest to GAIA?

Regards
Arjuna

All,

I have reviewed the =E2=80=9CAlternative Network Deployments=E2=80=9D =
Internet Draft and I have found several things that could be fixed, in =
order to make the text more concise and readable.

Issues to be considered
p.4 We should introduce the acronym AN for Alternative Networks, since =
we use it in the document.
p.5 The Free Network description does not read well here, since it MAY =
be the same as a Community Network. I suggest to create a separate =
sub-section, where we define a Free Network.
p.5 =E2=80=9CThe principles of these networks=E2=80=9D and p. 6 =E2=80=9CT=
hese networks grow=E2=80=A6=E2=80=9D.  It is not clear if we refer to =
community networks or free networks. We should make it clear.
p.6 =E2=80=9CThese networks are also called sometimes =E2=80=9CFree =
networks=E2=80=9D or even =E2=80=9CNetwork Commons.=E2=80=9D This is a =
confusing repetition and should be omitted.
p.7 =E2=80=9CThe network capacity shared=E2=80=A6=E2=80=9D This is a =
repetition, since it is already mentioned in the previous paragraph.
p.6-7 The way crowdshared approaches and user-centric approaches are =
defined right now is a little confusing, since they look really similar. =
We can add some examples of each case to highlight the differences.
p.7 FON missing reference: https://corp.fon.com/en =
<https://corp.fon.com/en>
p.8 The bullets that describe the actors in user-centric networks start =
abruptly. We should first add a sentence like =E2=80=9CThe actors =
involved in a user-centric network are summarised below:=E2=80=9D
p.8 We should define ISP and ASP acronyms when we first use them.
p.8 We should rename Section 2.4 Testbeds to Testbeds for research =
purposes to make it more clear.
p.8 Section 3.1 mostly describes developing countries and digital =
divide, not network deployment scenarios. For this reason, we could =
rename this section =E2=80=9CDigital Divide=E2=80=9D. We can also add a =
reference to the Digital Agenda Europe =
(http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/ =
<http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/>)
p.11 We should add a reference to dwellers that share the cost of the =
infrastructure ant the gateway and access it via inexpensive wireless =
devices.
p.11 We refer to scarce technical skills as a problem to rural areas. =
The same problem exists in developing countries, as well.
p.11 There is no need for a subsection 4.1.1. since it is the only one. =
We should re-write this paragraph more formally and move the reference =
to the end of the document.
p.11 Add one more introductory sentence to Section 4.2. =E2=80=9CBelow =
we summarise topics to be considered in such deployments.=E2=80=9D
p.11 We first refer to Fresnel zone in p.11, but we describe it in p.12. =
This explanation should be moved here.
p.13 Section 4.2.2. Link Length could be further split into three =
subsections: Line-of-Sight, Transmitted and Received Power and Medium =
Access Protocol.
p.17 Section 4.2.3.2. GMS should be re-written like =E2=80=9CGSM has =
also been used in Alternative Networks as layer 2 option.=E2=80=9D and =
reference should be moved to the end of the document.
p.19 When we refer to LEDBAT we can add the following two publications =
that summarise some important LEDBAT issues:
	-D.Ros and M. Welzl, =E2=80=9CAssessing LEDBAT=E2=80=99s delay =
impact=E2=80=9D, Communication Letters, IEEE, vol. 17, no. 5, pp. =
1044-1047, May 2013.
	-I. Komnios, A. Sathiaseelan and J. Crowcroft, =E2=80=9CLEDBAT =
performance in subpacket regimes=E2=80=9D, IEEE/IFIP WONS, Austria, =
April 2014.
p.19 Rename Section 5.2.1. "Services provided by these networks=E2=80=9D =
to =E2=80=9CServices provided by alternative networks=E2=80=9D
p.20 We should add an introduction to Section 5.2.1.1. such as =
=E2=80=9CIntranet services can include, but are not limited to:=E2=80=9D. =
And also make the first letter of each bullet capital.

Asunto: [gaia] Fixes to "Alternative Network Deployments" Internet Draft
=20
All,
=20
I have reviewed the =E2=80=9CAlternative Network Deployments=E2=80=9D =
Internet Draft and I have found several things that could be fixed, in =
order to make the text more concise and readable.
=20
Issues to be considered
p.4 We should introduce the acronym AN for Alternative Networks, since =
we use it in the document.
p.5 The Free Network description does not read well here, since it MAY =
be the same as a Community Network. I suggest to create a separate =
sub-section, where we define a Free Network.
p.5 =E2=80=9CThe principles of these networks=E2=80=9D and p. 6 =
=E2=80=9CThese networks grow=E2=80=A6=E2=80=9D.  It is not clear if we =
refer to community networks or free networks. We should make it clear.
p.6 =E2=80=9CThese networks are also called sometimes =E2=80=9CFree =
networks=E2=80=9D or even =E2=80=9CNetwork Commons.=E2=80=9D This is a =
confusing repetition and should be omitted.
p.7 =E2=80=9CThe network capacity shared=E2=80=A6=E2=80=9D This is a =
repetition, since it is already mentioned in the previous paragraph.
p.6-7 The way crowdshared approaches and user-centric approaches are =
defined right now is a little confusing, since they look really similar. =
We can add some examples of each case to highlight the differences.
p.7 FON missing reference: https://corp.fon.com/en
p.8 The bullets that describe the actors in user-centric networks start =
abruptly. We should first add a sentence like =E2=80=9CThe actors =
involved in a user-centric network are summarised below:=E2=80=9D
p.8 We should define ISP and ASP acronyms when we first use them.
p.8 We should rename Section 2.4 Testbeds to Testbeds for research =
purposes to make it more clear.
p.8 Section 3.1 mostly describes developing countries and digital =
divide, not network deployment scenarios. For this reason, we could =
rename this section =E2=80=9CDigital Divide=E2=80=9D. We can also add a =
reference to the Digital Agenda Europe =
(http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/)
p.11 We should add a reference to dwellers that share the cost of the =
infrastructure ant the gateway and access it via inexpensive wireless =
devices.
p.11 We refer to scarce technical skills as a problem to rural areas. =
The same problem exists in developing countries, as well.
p.11 There is no need for a subsection 4.1.1. since it is the only one. =
We should re-write this paragraph more formally and move the reference =
to the end of the document.
p.11 Add one more introductory sentence to Section 4.2. =E2=80=9CBelow =
we summarise topics to be considered in such deployments.=E2=80=9D
p.11 We first refer to Fresnel zone in p.11, but we describe it in p.12. =
This explanation should be moved here.
p.13 Section 4.2.2. Link Length could be further split into three =
subsections: Line-of-Sight, Transmitted and Received Power and Medium =
Access Protocol.
p.17 Section 4.2.3.2. GMS should be re-written like =E2=80=9CGSM has =
also been used in Alternative Networks as layer 2 option.=E2=80=9D and =
reference should be moved to the end of the document.
p.19 When we refer to LEDBAT we can add the following two publications =
that summarise some important LEDBAT issues:
          -D.Ros and M. Welzl, =E2=80=9CAssessing LEDBAT=E2=80=99s delay =
impact=E2=80=9D, Communication Letters, IEEE, vol. 17, no. 5, pp. =
1044-1047, May 2013.
          -I. Komnios, A. Sathiaseelan and J. Crowcroft, =E2=80=9CLEDBAT =

All,

Following my earlier email on two postdoctoral research associate
vacancies for my new EU H2020 RIFE project
(http://www.jobs.cam.ac.uk/job/5273/), I am also advertising another
vacancy for our another EU H2020 UMobile project (to work with Jon
Crowcroft and me). This project focusses more on the geographical
challenges of Internet provisioning.

I am looking forward to talk to candidates with strong ICN/systems
building expertise.
So please contact me at the earliest if interested.

Details below.

http://www.jobs.cam.ac.uk/job/5410/

One full time Research Associate position is available in the Computer
Laboratory at the University of Cambridge to work on the recently
awarded EU H2020 UMobile (Universal mobile centric and opportunistic
communications architecture) project. The project will explore the
fundamental challenges of enabling universal Internet access and
specifically explore innovative solutions using Information Centric
Networking to address mobility.

Responsibilities include, but are not limited to, system architecture
design and implementation, performance evaluation,
paper/proposal/document/report writing, and presentation of research
findings.

The successful candidate should have:

A first degree in the areas of Computer Science, Engineering or a
related discipline and, normally, a PhD (or be close to submitting
their thesis) relevant to the research area, or equivalent
qualifications.

Demonstrable research competence through high-quality and high-impact
publications in top conferences and journals.

Strong systems skills in one or more of the following: Linux kernel
programming, Click router platform, ns-3, Virtualisation platforms,
Mininet and Blackadder. Prior experience building testbeds and
real-world deployments are considered an advantage.

Proven experience in building Information Centric Systems.

Experience with satellite/wireless/Unmanned Aerial Vehicles networking.

Experience with Quality of Service techniques, Radio Resource
Management and efficient edge caching techniques are considered an
advantage.

Candidates holding some of the skills and experience mentioned above
may be considered for this position but will be appointed on the
Research Assistant scale (=C2=A324,775-=C2=A327,864).

The expected start date will be February 2015.

Interested applicants are encouraged to make informal enquiries about
the post to Arjuna Sathiaseelan (arjuna.sathiaseelan@cl.cam.ac.uk) and
Prof. Jon Crowcroft (jon.crowcroft@cl.cam.ac.uk).

I agree in large part with this article although there is one part that
raises a yellow flag for me:

"Another cost barrier is the cost of billing. Some users do not have bank
accounts or credit cards. However, they will have social security numbers
through which the cost of providing them internet access can be paid off
through other connected services =E2=80=93 for example, through additions t=
o tax
bills or deductions from benefits."

One possible negative outcome of this is that the disadvantaged end up
paying with their privacy for access.  We see this happening with many
programmes to assist the poor that can have the negative side-effect of
disempowering them through finding their way into databases that may
trigger additional surveillance or more subtle forms of discrimination.

The program for ACM DEV 5 in San Jose Dec 5-6 is now here:
http://acmdev.org/program/.

The GAIA workshop will be on Dec 4. The final program is here:
https://sites.google.com/site/irtfgaia/home/3rd-gaia-meeting

We are currently talking to the Internet.org folks to see if they can
come and talk about their work (as a panel session on Dec 5). This is
yet to be confirmed. Marco Zennaro and I are meeting the Internet.org
folks on Dec 3rd to talk about the activities of GAIA.

Hoping to see you all there at DEV.

Regards

Hi Arjuna,

Is there a particular reason that only 802.11af is mentioned when it comes
to TVWS?  Would it not make sense to include 802.22 alongside 802.1af in
section 4.2.3.1.2.

Regards... Steve

&gt; p.6-7 The way crowdshared approaches and user-centric approaches are d=

Hello Steve,
  I think this is a good suggestion and we should also add 802.22.

Also I think we need to add more details on TVWS. We will work with

Thanks once again Steve.

Regards

Cool stuff.  A couple of the findings seem very consistent with a few of =
Srikanth Sundaresan=E2=80=99s research on Web performance:

1. "=46rom our measurements over the past twoyears, we observed that DNS =
is a critical bottleneck in pageload times and even the deployment of =
simple ideas such as DNS caching can help improve the end-to-end =
performance.=E2=80=9D

This agrees with the findings of our earlier study on improving Web =
performance bottlenecks in home networks:
http://conferences.sigcomm.org/imc/2013/papers/imc120-sundaresanA.pdf

See, in particular Section 6, which talks about caching DNS records (and =
TCP connections) in home routers.

2. "Apart from DNS, we found that because of the lack of server =
infrastructure within the country, every request needs to berouted to US =
or European countries thereby incurring a high network latency =
penalty.=E2=80=9D

This agrees with our DEV paper from last year:
http://www1.icsi.berkeley.edu/~srikanth/docs/broadband-sa-dev4.pdf

Check out Section 4.2, and in particular, the paragraph with the heading =
=E2=80=9CLatency to popular websites=E2=80=9D on page 8.

Hi,
I made a few changes in the document, highlighted in red in the attached
pdf, and a short mention of the 802.22 standard, since, to the best of my
knowledge, it has not been implemented in any of the White Spaces products
currently available.

Best regards,
Ermanno

    *Alternative Network Deployments.  Taxonomy and characterization*

               *draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01*


Abstract


   This document presents a taxonomy of "alternative network

   deployments", and a set of definitions and shared characteristics.

   This term includes a set of network models emerged in the last

   decades with the aim of bringing Internet connectivity to people,

   following topological, architectural and business models different

   from the so-called "traditional" ones, where a company deploys the

   infrastructure connecting the households of the users, who pay for

   it.


   Several initiatives throughout the World have built large scale

   networks that use wireless technologies (including long distance) due

   to the reduced cost of using the unlicensed spectrum.  Others rely on

   wired technologies.  Some of these networks are self-organized and

   decentralized, other ones are based on sharing wireless resources of

   the users.  The emergence of these networks can be motivated by

   different causes: Sometimes the reluctance, or the impossibility, of

   network operators to provide wired and cellular infrastructures to

   rural/remote areas.  In these cases, the networks have self

   sustainable business models that provide more localised communication

   services as well as providing Internet backhaul support through

   peering agreements with traditional network operators.  Some other

   times, they are built as a complement and an alternative to

   commercial Internet access provided by "traditional" network

   operators.

Internet-Draft       Alternative Network Deployments        October 2014



   The classification considers different existing network models as

   e.g., community networks, open wireless services, user-extensible

   services, traditional local ISPs, new global ISPs, etc.  Different

   criteria are used in order to build a classification as e.g., the

   ownership of the equipment, the way the network is organized, the

   participatory model, the extensibility, if they are driven by a

   community, a company or a local (public or private) stakeholder, etc.


   According to the developed taxonomy, a characterization of each kind

   of network is presented, in terms of network characteristics related

   to architecture, organization, etc.

Introduction*


   Several initiatives throughout the World have built large scale

   networks that use wireless technologies (including long distance) due

   to the reduced cost of using the unlicensed spectrum.  Others rely on

   wired technologies.  Some of them are self-organized and

   decentralized, other ones are based on sharing wireless resources of

   the users.  The emergence of these networks can be motivated by

   different causes: Sometimes the reluctance, or the impossibility, of

   network operators to provide wired and cellular infrastructures to

   rural/remote areas [Pietrosemoli
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#ref-=
Pietrosemoli>].
In these cases, the networks have

   self sustainable business models that provide more localised

   communication services as well as providing Internet backhaul support

   through peering agreements with traditional network operators.  Some

   other times, they are built as a complement and an alternative to

   commercial Internet access provided by "traditional" network

   operators.


   One of the aims of the Global Access to the Internet for All (GAIA)

   IRTF initiative is "to document and share deployment experiences and

   research results to the wider community through scholarly

   publications, white papers, Informational and Experimental RFCs,

   etc."  In line with this objective this document is intended to

   propose a classification of these "alternative network deployments".

   This term includes a set of network models emerged in the last

   decades with the aim of bringing Internet connectivity to people,

   following topological, architectural and business models different

   from the so-called "traditional" ones, where a company deploys the

   infrastructure connecting the households of the users, who pay for

   it.  The document is intended to be largely descriptive providing a

   broad overview of initiatives, technologies and approaches employed

   in these networks.  Research references describing each kind of

   network are also provided.

Classification*


   This section classifies Alternative Networks according to their

   intended usage.  Each of them have different incentive structures,

   maybe common technological challenges, but most importantly

   interesting usage challenges which feeds into the incentives as well

   as technological challenges.


   This classification is agnostic from the technical point of view.

   Technology in this case must be taken as implementation.  Moreover,

   many of these networks are implemented in a way that several

   technologies (Ad-Hoc WiFi, Infrastructure WiFi, Optical Fibre, IPv4,

   IPv6, RFC1918 <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918>, OLSR, BMX6, etc.)
coexist.

*2.1*
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#sect=
ion-2.1>*.
Community Networks*


   Community Networks are large-scale, distributed, self-managed

   networks sharing these characteristics:


   - They are built and organized in a decentralized and open manner.


   - They start and grow organically, they are open to participation

   from everyone, sometimes agreeing to an open peering agreement.

   Community members are directly contributing active network

   infrastructure (not just passive infrastructure).


   - Knowledge about building and maintaining the network and ownership

   of the network itself is decentralized and open.  Community members

   have an obvious and direct form of organizational control over the

   overall operation of the network in their community (not just their

   own participation in the network).


   - The network CAN serve as a backhaul for providing a whole range of

   services and applications, from completely free to even commercial

   services.


   Hardware and software used in community networks CAN be very diverse,

   even inside one network.  A Community Network CAN have both wired and

   wireless links.  The network CAN be managed by multiple routing

   protocols or network topology management systems.


   A definition of Free Network (which MAY be the same as Community

   Network) is proposed by the Free Network Foundation (see

   http://thefnf.org) as:


   A free network equitably grants the following freedoms to all:


   Freedom 0 - Freedom to communicate for any purpose, without

   discrimination, interference, or interception.


   Freedom 1 - The freedom to grow, improve, communicate across, and

   connect to the whole network.


   Freedom 2- The freedom to study, use, remix, and share any network

   communication mechanisms, in their most reusable forms."


   The principles of these networks have also been summarized (see

   http://guifi.net/ca/CXOLN) this way:


   - You have the freedom to use the network for any purpose as long as

   you don't harm the operation of the network itself , the rights of





Saldana, et al.           Expires April 9, 2015                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft       Alternative Network Deployments        October 2014



   other users, or the principles of neutrality that allow contents and

   services to flow without deliberate interference.


   - You have the right to understand the network, to know its

   components, and to spread knowledge of its mechanisms and principles.


   - You have the right to offer services and content to the network on

   your own terms.


   - You have the right to join the network, and the responsibility to

   extend this set of rights to anyone according to these same terms.


   These networks grow organically, since they are formed by the

   aggregation of nodes belonging to different users.  A minimum

   governance infrastructure is required in order to coordinate IP

   addressing, routing, etc.  A clear example of this kind of Community

   Network is described in [Braem
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#ref-=
Braem>].
These networks are effective in

   enhancing and extending digital Internet rights following a

   participatory model.


   The fact of the users adding new infrastructure can be used to build

   another definition: A network in which any participant in the system

   may add link segments to the network in such a way that the new

   network segments can support multiple nodes and adopt the same

   overall characteristics as those of the joined network, including the

   capacity to further extend the network.  Once these link segments are

   joined to the network, there is no longer a meaningful distinction

   between the previous extent of the network and the new extent of the

   network.  In that sense, Community Networks can be called "user-

   extensible networks".


   These networks are also called sometimes "Free Networks" or even

   "Network Commons".  However, the most accepted name is Community

   Networks.


   In Community Networks, the profit can only be made by services and

   not by the infrastructure itself, because the infrastructure is

   neutral, free, and open (traditional ISPs base their business on the

   control of the infrastructure).  In Community Networks, everybody

   keeps the ownership of what he/she has contributed.

Crowdshared approaches, led by the people and third party*

*      stakeholders*


   These networks follow the following approach: the home router creates tw=
o

   wireless networks, one of them to be normally used by the owner, and

   the other one is public.  A small fraction of the bandwidth is

   allocated to the public network (as e.g.  Less-than-best-effort or




Saldana, et al.           Expires April 9, 2015                 [Page 6]

   scavenger traffic), to be employed by any user of the service in the

   immediate area.  An example is described in [PAWS
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#ref-=
PAWS>
].


   A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is created for public traffic, so it

   is completely secure and separated from the owner's connection.  The

   network capacity shared may employ a less-than-best-effort approach,

   so as not to harm the traffic of the owner of the connection

   [Sathiaseelan_a
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#ref-=
Sathiaseelan_a>
].


   There are three actors in the scenario:


   - End users who sign up for the service and share their network

   capacity.  As a counterpart, they can access anyone's home broadband

   for free.


   - Virtual Network Operators (VNOs) are stakeholders with socio-

   environmental objectives.  They can be a local government, grass root

   user communities, charities, or even content operators, smart grid

   operators, etc.  They are the ones who actually run the service.


   - Network operators, who have a financial incentive to lease out the

   unused capacity [Sathiaseelan_b
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#ref-=
Sathiaseelan_b>]
at lower cost to the VNOs.


   VNOs pay the sharers and the network operators, thus creating an

   incentive structure for all the actors: the end users get money for

   sharing their network, the network operators are paid by the VNOs,

   who in turn accomplish their socio-environmental role.


*2.3*
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#sect=
ion-2.3>*.
User-centric Networks*


   A first example is constituted by the networks created and managed by
City Councils

   (e.g., [Heer
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#ref-=
Heer>]).
Some companies [FON reference missing] develop and

   sell Wi-Fi routers with a dual access: a Wi-Fi network for the user,

   and a shared one.  A user community is created, an people can join it

   different ways: they can buy a dual router, so they share their

   connection and in turn they get access to all the routers associated

   to the community.  Some users can even get some revenues every time

   another user connects to their Wi-Fi spot.  Other users can just buy

   some passes in order to use the network.  Some telecommunications

   operators can collaborate with the community, including in their

   routers the possibility of creating these two networks.


   These networks can be defined as a set of nodes whose owners share

   common interests (e.g. sharing connectivity; resources; peripherals)

   regardless of their physical location.  The node location exhibits a

   space and time correlation which is the basis to establish a robust

   connectivity model over time.

   - "Interest": a parameter capable of providing a measure (cost) of

   the attractiveness of a node towards a specific location, in a

   specific instant in time.


   - The owner: an entity (e.g. end-user; operator; virtual operator;

   municipality) that is to be made responsible for any actions

   concerning his/her device.


   - The user: a legal entity or an individual using or requesting a

   publicly available electronic communications' service for private or

   business purposes, without necessarily having subscribed to such

   service.


   - Resources: A physical or virtual element of a global system.  For

   instance, bandwdith; energy; data; devices.


   - The Virtual Operator: entity that acts in some aspects as a network

   coordinator.  It may provide services such as initial authentication

   or registering, and eventually, trust relationship storage.  A VO is

   not an ISP given that it does not provide Internet access (e.g.

   infrastructure; naming).  A VO is neither an ASP since it does not

   provide user services.

Testbed*


   In some cases, the initiative to start the network is not from the

   community, but from a research entity (e.g. a university), with the

   aim of using it for research purposes [Samanta

Scenarios where Alternative Networks are deployed*


   Alternative Network Deployments are present in every part of the

   World.  Even in some high-income countries, these networks have been

   built as an alternative to commercial ones managed by traditional

   network operators.  This section discusses the scenarios where

   alternative networks are interesting or have been deployed.

Alternative Networks depending on the income level of each country*


   There is no definition for what a developing country represents that

   has been recognized internationally, but the term is generally used

   to describe a nation with a low level of material well-being.  In

   this sense, one of the most commonly used classification is the one

   by the World Bank, who ranks countries according to their Gross

   National Income (GNI) per Capita: low income, middle income, and high

   income, being those falling within the low and middle income groups

   considered developing economies.  Developing countries have been also

   defined as those which are in transition from traditional lifestyles




Saldana, et al.           Expires April 9, 2015                 [Page 8]


<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#page=

Internet-Draft       Alternative Network Deployments        October 2014



   towards the modern lifestyle which began in the Industrial

   Revolution.  Additionally, the Human Development Index, which

   considers not only the GNI but also life expectancy and education,

   has been proposed by the United Nations to rank countries according

   to the well-being of a country and not solely based on economic

   terms.  These classifications are used to give strong signals to the

   international community to the need of special concessions in support

   of these countries, implying a correlation between development and

   increased well-being.


   However, at the beginning of the 90's the debates about how to

   quantify development in a country were shaken by the appearance of

   Internet and mobile phones, which many authors consider the beginning

   of the Information Society.  With the beginning of this Digital

   Revolution, defining development based on Industrial Society concepts

   started to be challenged, and links between digital development and

   its impact on human development started to flourish.  The following

   dimensions are considered to be meaningful when measuring the digital

   development state of a country: infrastructures (availability and

   affordability); ICT sector (human capital and technological

   industry); digital literacy; legal and regulatory framework; and

   content and services.  The lack or less extent of digital development

   in one or more of these dimensions is what has been referred as

   Digital Divide.  This divide is a new vector of inequality which - as

   it happened during the Industrial Revolution - generates a lot of

   progress at the expense of creating a lot economic poverty and

   exclusion.  The Digital Divide is considered to be a consequence of

   other socio-economic divides, while, at the same time, a reason for

   their rise.


   In this context, the so-called "developing countries", worried of

   being left behind of this incipient digital revolution, motivated the

   World Summit of the Information Society which aimed at achieving "a

   people-centred, inclusive and development-oriented Information

   Society, where everyone can create, access, utilize and share

   information and knowledge, enabling individuals, communities and

   peoples to achieve their full potential in promoting their

   sustainable development and improving their quality of life" [WSIS
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#ref-=

],

   and called upon "governments, private sector, civil society and

   international organisations" to actively engage to accomplish it

   [WSIS
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#ref-=
WSIS>
].


   Most efforts from governments and international organizations focused

   initially on improving and extending the existing infrastructure in
order to not  leave their population behind.  Universal Access and Service

   plans have taken different forms in different countries over the

   years, with very uneven success rates, but in most cases inadequate

   to the scale of the problem.  Given its incapacity to solve the

   problem, some governments included Universal Service and Access

   obligations to mobile network operators when liberalizing the

   telecommunications market.  In combination with the overwhelming and

   unexpected uptake of mobile phones by poor people, this has mitigated

   the low access indicators existing in many developing countries at

   the beginning of the 90s [Rendon
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#ref-=
Rendon>
].


   Although it is undeniable the contribution made by mobile network

   operators in decreasing the access gap, their model presents some

   constraints that limits the development outcomes that increased

   connectivity promises to bring.  Prices, tailored for the more

   affluent part of the population, remain unaffordable to many, who

   invest large percentages of their disposable income in

   communications.  Additionally, the cost of prepaid packages, the only

   option available for the informal economies existing throughout

   developing countries, is high compared with the rate longer-term

   subscribers pay.


   The consolidation of many Alternative Networks (e.g.  Community

   Networks) in high income countries sets a precedent for civil society

   members from the so-called developing countries to become more active

   in the search for alternatives to provide themselves with affordable

   access.  Furthermore, Alternative Networks could contribute to other

   dimensions of the digital development like increased human capital

   and the creation of contents and services targeting the locality of

   each network.

Urban vs. rural areas*


   The Digital Divide presented in the previous section is not only

   present between countries, but within them too.  This is specially

   the case for rural inhabitants, which represents approximately 55% of

   the World's population, from which 78% inhabit in developing

   countries.  Although it is impossible to generalize among them, there

   exist some common features that have determined the availability of

   ICT infrastructure in these regions.  The disposable income of their

   dwellers is lower than those inhabiting urban areas, with many

   surviving on a subsistence economy.  Many of them are located in

   geographies difficult to access and exposed to extreme weather

   conditions.  This has resulted in the almost complete lack of

   electrical infrastructure.  This context, together with their low

   population density, discourages telecommunications operators to

   provide similar services to those provided to urban dwellers, since

   they do not deem them profitable


   The cost of the wireless infrastructure required to set up a network,

   including powering them via solar energy, is within the range of

   availability if not of individuals at least of entire communities.

   The social capital existing in these areas can allow for Alternative

   Network set-ups where a reduced number of nodes may cover communities

   whose dwellers share the cost of the infrastructure and the gateway

   and access it via inexpensive wireless devices.  In this case, the

   lack of awareness and confidence of rural communities to embark

   themselves in such tasks can become major barriers to their

   deployment.  Scarce technical skills in these regions have been also

   pointed as a challenge for their success, but the proliferation of

   urban Community Networks, where scarcity of spectrum, scale, and

   heterogeneity of devices pose tremendous challenges to their

   stability and to that of the services they aim to provide, has

   fuelled the creation of robust low-cost low-consumption low-

   complexity off-the-self wireless devices which make much easier the

   deployment and maintenance of these alternative infrastructures in

   rural areas.

Antennas*


   Three kinds of antennas are suitable to be used in these networks:

   omnidirectional, directional and high gain antennas.


   For local access, omnidirectional antennas are the most useful, since

   they provide the same coverage in all directions of the plane in

   which they are located.  Above and below this plane, the received

   signal will diminish, so the maximum benefits are obtained when the

   client is at approximately the same height as the Access Point.




Saldana, et al.           Expires April 9, 2015                [Page 11]


<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#page=
-12>

Internet-Draft       Alternative Network Deployments        October 2014



   When using an omnidirectional antenna outdoors to provide

   connectivity to a large area, people often select high gain antennas

   located at the highest structure available to extend the coverage.

   In many cases this is counterproductive, since a high gain

   omnidirectional antenna will have a very narrow beamwidth in the

   vertical plane, meaning that clients that are below the plane of the

   antenna will receive a very weak signal (and by the reciprocity

   property of all antennas, the omni will also receive a feeble signal

   from the client).  So a moderate gain omnidirectional of about 8 to

   10 dBi is normally preferable.  Higher gain omnis antennas are only

   advisable when the farthest way client are roughly in the same plane.


   For indoor clients, omnis are generally fine, because the numerous

   reflections normally found in indoor environments negate the

   advantage of using directive antennas.


   For outdoor clients, directive antennas can be quite useful to extend

   coverage to an Access Point fitted with an omni.


   When building point to point links, the highest gain antennas are the

   best choice, since their narrow beamwidth mitigates interference from

   other users and can provide the longest links [Flickenger
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#ref-=
Flickenger>]
[Zennaro
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#ref-=
Zennaro>
].


   24 to 34 dBi antennas are commercially available at both the

   unlicensed 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands, and even higher gain antennas can

   be found in the newer unlicensed bands at 17 GHz and 24 GHz.


   Despite the fact that the free space loss is directly proportional to

   the square of the frequency, it is normally advisable to use higher

   frequencies for point to point links when there is a clear line of

   sight, because it is normally easier to get higher gain antennas at

   5 GHz.  Deploying high gain antennas at both ends will more than

   compensate for the additional free space loss.  Furthermore, higher

   frequencies can make do with lower altitude antenna placement since

   the Fresnel zone is inversely proportional to the square root of the

   frequency.


   On the contrary, lower frequencies offer advantages when the line of

   sight is blocked because they can leverage diffraction to reach the

   intended receiver.


   It is common to find dual radio Access Points, at two different

   frequency bands.  One way of benefiting from this arrangement is to

   attach a directional antenna to the high frequency radio for

   connection to the backbone and an omni to the lower frequency to

   provide local access.

Internet-Draft       Alternative Network Deployments        October 2014



   Of course, in the case of mesh networking, where the antenna should

   connect to several other nodes, it is better to use omnidirectional

   antennas.


   Keep also in mind that the same type of polarisation must be used at

   both ends of any radio link.  For point to point links, some vendor

   use two radios operating at the same frequency but with orthogonal

   polarisations, thus doubling the achievable throughput, and also

   offering added protection to multipath and other transmission

   impairments.


*4.2.2*
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#sect=
ion-4.2.2>*.
Link length*


   For short distance transmission, there is no strict requirement of

   line of sight between the transmitter and the receiver, and multipath

   can guarantee communication despite the existence of obstacles in the

   direct path.


   For longer distances, the first requirement is the existence of an

   unobstructed line of sight between the transmitter and the receiver.

   For very long path the earth curvature is an obstacle that must be

   cleared, but the trajectory of the radio beam is not strictly a

   straight line due to the bending of the rays as a consequence of non-

   uniformities of the atmosphere.  Most of the time this bending will

   mean that the radio horizon extends further than the optical horizon.


   Another factor to be considered is that radio waves occupy a volume

   around the optical line, which must be unencumbered from obstacles

   for the maximum signal to be captured at the receiver.  This volume

   is known as the Fresnel ellipsoid and its size grows with the

   distance between the end points and with the wavelength of the

   signal, which in turn is inversely proportional to the frequency.


   So, for optimum signal reception the end points must be high enough

   to clear any obstacle in the path and leave extra "elbow room" for

   the Fresnel zone.  This can be achieved by using suitable masts at

   either end, or by taking advantage of existing structures or hills.


   Once a clear radio-electric line of sight (including the Fresnel zone

   clearance) is obtained, one must ascertain that the received power is

   well above the sensitivity of the receiver, by what is known as the

   link margin.  The greater the link margin, the more reliable the

   link.  For mission critical applications 20 dB margin is suggested,

   but for non critical ones 10 dB might suffice.


   Bear in mind that the sensitivity of the receiver decreases with the

   transmission speed, so more power is needed at greater transmission

   speeds.

-14>

Internet-Draft       Alternative Network Deployments        October 2014



   The received power is determined by the transmitted power, the gain

   of the transmitting and receiving antennas and the propagation loss.


   The propagation loss is the sum of the free space loss (proportional

   to the square of the the frequency and the square of the distance),

   plus additional factors like attenuation in the atmosphere by gases

   or meteorological effects (which are strongly frequency dependent),

   multipath and diffraction losses.


   Multipath is more pronounced in trajectories over water, if they

   cannot be avoided special countermeasures should be taken.


   So to achieve a given link margin (also called fade margin), one can:


   a) increase the output power. The maximum transmitted power is

   specified by the country's regulation, and for unlicensed frequencies

   is much lower than for licensed frequencies.


   b) Increase the antenna gain.  There is no limit in the gain of the

   receiving antenna, but high gain antennas are bulkier, present more

   wind resistance and require sturdy mounts to comply with tighter

   alignment requirements.  The transmitter antenna gain is also

   regulated and can be different for point to point as for point to

   multipoint links.  Many countries impose a limit in the combination

   of transmitted power and antenna gain, the EIRP (Equivalent

   Isotropically Irradiated Power) which can be different for point to

   point or point to multipoint links.


   c) Reduce the propagation loss, by using a more favourable frequency

   or a shorter path.


   d) Use a more sensitive receiver.  Receiver sensitivity can be

   improved by using better circuits, but it is ultimately limited by

   the thermal noise, which is proportional to temperature and

   bandwidth.  So one can increase the sensitivity by using a smaller

   receiving bandwidth, or by settling to lower throughput even in the

   same receiver bandwidth.  This step is often done automatically in

   many protocols, in which the transmission speed can be reduced say

   from 150 Mbit/s to 6 Mbit/s if the receiver power is not enough to

   sustain the maximum throughput.


   A completely different limiting factor is related with the medium

   access protocol.  WiFi was designed for short distance, and the

   transmitter expects the reception of an acknowledgment for each

   transmitted packet in a certain amount of time, if the waiting time

   is exceeded, the packet is retransmitted.  This will reduce

   significantly the throughput at long distance, so for long distance

   application it is better to use a different medium access technique,

   in which the receiver does not wait for an acknowledgement of the

   transited packet.  This strategy of TDMA (Time Domain Multiple

   Access) has been adopted by many equipment vendors who offer

   proprietary protocols alongside the standard WiFi in order to

   increase the throughput at longer distances.  Low cost equipment

   using TDMA can offer high throughput at distances over 100

   kilometres.

Deployment planning for 802.11 wireless networks*


   Before packets can be forwarded and routed to the Internet, layers

   one (the physical) and two (the data link) need to be connected.

   Without link local connectivity, network nodes cannot talk to each

   other and route packets.


   To provide physical connectivity, wireless network devices must

   operate in the same part of the radio spectrum.  This means that

   802.11a radios will talk to 802.11a radios at around 5 GHz, and

   802.11b/g radios will talk to other 802.11b/g radios at around 2.4

   GHz.  But an 802.11a device cannot interoperate with an 802.11b/g

   device, since they use completely different parts of the

   electromagnetic spectrum.  More specifically, wireless interfaces

   must agree on a common channel.  If one 802.11b radio card is set to

   channel 2 while another is set to channel 11, then the radios cannot

   communicate with each other.


   When two wireless interfaces are configured to use the same protocol

   on the same radio channel, then they are ready to negotiate data link

   layer connectivity.  Each 802.11a/b/g device can operate in one of

   four possible modes:


   1.Master mode (also called AP or infrastructure mode) is used to

   create a service that looks like a traditional access point.  The

   wireless interface creates a network with a specified name (called

   the SSID) and channel, and offers network services on it.  While in

   master mode, wireless interfaces manage all communications related to

   the network (authenticating wireless clients, handling channel

   contention, repeating packets, etc.)  Wireless interfaces in master

   mode can only communicate with interfaces that are associated with

   them in managed mode.


   2.Managed mode is sometimes also referred to as client mode.

   Wireless interfaces in managed mode will join a network created by a

   master, and will automatically change their channel to match it.

   They then present any necessary credentials to the master, and if

   those credentials are accepted, they are said to be associated with

   the master.  Managed mode interfaces do not communicate with each

   other directly, and will only communicate with an associated master.


   3.Ad-hoc mode creates a multipoint-to-multipoint network where there

   is no single master node or AP.  In ad-hoc mode, each wireless

   interface communicates directly with its neighbours.  Nodes must be

   in range of each other to communicate, and must agree on a network

   name and channel.  Ad-hoc mode is often also called Mesh Networking.

-17>

Internet-Draft       Alternative Network Deployments        October 2014



   4.Monitor mode is used by some tools (such as Kismet) to passively

   listen to all radio traffic on a given channel.  When in monitor mode,

   wireless interfaces transmit no data.  This is useful for analysing

   problems on a wireless link or observing spectrum usage in the local

   area.  Monitor mode is not used for normal communications.


   When implementing a point-to-point or point-to-multipoint link, one

   radio will typically operate in master mode, while the other(s)

   operate in managed mode.  In a multipoint-to-multipoint mesh, the

   radios all operate in ad-hoc mode so that they can communicate with

   each other directly.  Remember that managed mode clients cannot

   communicate with each other directly, so it is likely that you will

   want to run a high repeater site in master or ad-hoc mode.  Ad-hoc is

   more flexible but has a number of performance issues as compared to

   using the master / managed modes.

IP addressing*


   Most known Alternative Networks started in or around the year 2000.

   IPv6 was fully specified by then, but almost all Alternative

   Networks still use IPv4.  A community networks survey [Avonts
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#ref-=
Avonts>
]

   indicated that IPv6 rollout presents a challenge to Community Networks.


   Most Community Networks use private IPv4 address ranges, as defined

   by RFC 1918 <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918> [RFC1918
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918>].  The motivation for this was the
lower cost

   and the simplified IP allocation because of the large available

   address ranges.

*5.1.2*
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#sect=
ion-5.1.2>*.
Routing protocols*


   These networks are composed of possibly different layer 2 devices,

   resulting in a mesh of nodes.  Connection between different nodes is

   not guaranteed, the link stability can vary strongly over time.  To

   tackle this, some Community Networks use mesh network routing

   protocols while other networks use more traditional routing

   protocols.  Some networks operate multiple routing protocols in

   parallel.  E.g., they use a mesh protocol inside different islands

   and use traditional routing protocols to connect islands.


*5.1.2.1*
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#sect=
ion-5.1.2.1>*.
Traditional routing protocols*


   The BGP protocol, as defined by RFC 4271
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4271> [RFC4271
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4271>] is used by a

   number of Community Networks, because of its well-studied behavior

   and scalability.


   For similar reasons, smaller Community Networks opt to run the OSPF

   protocol, as defined by RFC 2328 <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2328> [
RFC2328 <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2328>].


*5.1.2.2*
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#sect=
ion-5.1.2.2>*.
Mesh routing protocols*


   A large number of Community Networks use the OLSR routing protocol as

   defined in RFC 3626 <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3626> [RFC3626
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3626>].  The pro-active link state routing

   protocol is a good match with Community Networks because it has good

   performance in mesh networks where nodes have multiple interfaces.


   The Better Approach To Mobile Adhoc Networking (B.A.T.M.A.N.)

   [Abolhasan
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#ref-=
Abolhasan>]protocol
was developed by members of the Freifunk

   community.  The protocol handles all routing at layer 2, creating one

   bridged network.


   Parallel to BGP, some networks also run the BMX6 protocol [Neumann
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#ref-=
Neumann>
].

   This is an advanced version of the BATMAN protocol which is based on

   IPv6 and tries to exploit the social structure of Community Networks.

Upper layers*


   From crowd shared perspective, and considering just regular TCP

   connections during the critical sharing time, the Access Point

   offering the service is likely to be the bottleneck of the

   connection.  This is the main concern of sharers, having several

   implications.  There should be an adequate Active Queue Management

   (AQM) mechanism that implements a Less than Best Effort policy for the

   user and protect the sharer.  Achieving LBE behaviour requires the

   appropriate tuning of the well known mechanisms such as ECN, or RED,

   or others more recent AQM mechanisms such as CoDel and PIE that aid

   on keeping low latency RFC 6297 <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6297> [
RFC6297 <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6297>].

   The user traffic should not interfere with the sharers traffic.

   However, other bottlenecks besides client's access bottleneck may not

   be controlled by the previously mentioned protocols.  Therefore, recentl=
y

   proposed transport protocols like LETBAT [reference required] with

   the purpose of transporting scavenger traffic may be a solution.

   LEDBAT requires the cooperation of both the client and the server to

   achieve certain target delay, therefore controlling the impact of the

   user along all the path.


   There are applications that manage aspects of the network from the

   sharer side and from the client side.  From sharer's side, there are

   applications to centralise the management of the APs conforming the

   network that have been recently proposed by means of SDN

   [Sathiaseelan_a
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#ref-=
Sathiaseelan_a>]
[Suresh
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#ref-=
Suresh>].
There are also other proposals such as

   Wi2Me [Lampropulos
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#ref-=
Lampropulos>]
that manage the connection to several Community

   Networks from the client's side.  This application have shown to

   improve the client performance compared to a single-Community Network

   client.


   On the other hand, transport protocols inside a multiple hop wireless

   mesh network are likely to suffer performance degradation for

   multiple reasons, e.g., hidden terminal problem, unnecessary delays

   on the TCP ACK clocking that decrease the throughout or route

   changing [Hanbali
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#ref-=
Hanbali>].
So, there are some options for network

   configuration.  The implementation of an easy-to-adopt solution for

   TCP over mesh networks may be implemented from two different

   perspectives.  One way is to use a TCP-proxy to transparently deal

   with the different impairments RFC 3135
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3135> [RFC3135
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3135>].  Another way is to

   adopt end-to-end solutions for monitoring the connection delay so

   that the receiver adapts the TCP reception window (rwnd)

   [Castignani_c
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#ref-=
Castignani_c>].
Similarly, the ACK Congestion Control (ACKCC)

   mechanism RFC 5690 <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5690> [RFC5690
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5690>] could deal with TCP-ACK clocking

   impairments due to inappropriate delay on ACK packets.  ACKCC

   compensates in an end-to-end fashion the throughput degradation due

   to the effect of media contention as well as the unfairness

   experienced by multiple uplink TCP flows in a congested WiFi access.

<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#sect=

Topology*


   These networks follow different topology patterns, as studied in

   [Vega
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#ref-=
Vega>
].


   Regularly rural areas in these networks are connected through long-

   distance links (the so-called community mesh approach) which in turn

   convey the Internet connection to relevant organisations or

   institutions.  In contrast, in urban areas, users tend to share and

   require mobile access.  Since these areas are also likely to be

   covered by commercial ISPs, the provision of wireless access by

   Virtual Operators like FON is the way to extend the user capacity (or

   gain connection) to the network.  Other proposals like Virtual Public

   Networks [Sathiaseelan_a
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#ref-=
Sathiaseelan_a>]
can also extend the service.


   As in the case of main Internet Service Providers in France,

   Community Networks for urban areas are conceived as a set of APs

   sharing a common SSID among the clients favouring the nomadic access.

   For users in France, ISPs promise to cause a little impact on their

   service agreement when the shared network service is activated on

   clients' APs.  Nowadays, millions of APs are deployed around the

   country performing services of nomadism and 3G offloading, however as

   some studies demonstrate, at walking speed, there is a fair chance

   of performing file transfers [Castignani_a
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#ref-=
Castignani_a>]
[Castignani_b
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#ref-=
Castignani_b>
].

   Scenarios studied in France and Luxembourg show that the density of APs
in

   urban areas (mainly in downtown and residential areas) is quite big and

   from different ISPs.  Moreover, performed studies reveal that
aggregating

   available networks can be

   beneficial to the client by using an application that manage the best

   connection among the different networks.  For improving the scanning

   process (or topology recognition), which consumes the 90% of the

   connection/reconnection process to the Community Network, the client

   may implement several techniques for selecting the best AP

<p class=3D"">=C2=A0=C2=A0 different causes: Sometimes the reluctance, or t=

I was wondering... perhaps you could contribute two paragraphs about 802.22=
 for the draft...<br>

&gt; Hello Steve,<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0I think this is a good suggestion and we should also add 8=
02.22.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Also I think we need to add more details on TVWS. We will work with Ma=
rco and<br>
&gt; Ermanno on this.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Thanks once again Steve.<br>
&gt;<br>

&gt; &gt; Is there a particular reason that only 802.11af is mentioned when=
 it<br>
&gt; &gt; comes to TVWS?=C2=A0 Would it not make sense to include 802.22 al=

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I have reviewed the =E2=80=9CAlternative Network Deploym=
ents=E2=80=9D Internet<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Draft and I have found several things that could be fixe=
d, in order<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to make the text more concise and readable.<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Issues to be considered<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; p.4 We should introduce the acronym AN for Alternative N=
etworks,<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; since we use it in the document.<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; p.5 The Free Network description does not read well here=
, since it<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; MAY be the same as a Community Network. I suggest to cre=
ate a<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; separate sub-section, where we define a Free Network.<br=
>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; p.5 =E2=80=9CThe principles of these networks=E2=80=9D a=
nd p. 6 =E2=80=9CThese networks grow=E2=80=A6=E2=80=9D.<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; It<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; is not clear if we refer to community networks or free n=
etworks. We<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; should make it clear.<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; p.6 =E2=80=9CThese networks are also called sometimes =
=E2=80=9CFree networks=E2=80=9D or<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; even =E2=80=9CNetwork Commons.=E2=80=9D This is a confus=
ing repetition and should be<br>
&gt; omitted.<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; p.7 =E2=80=9CThe network capacity shared=E2=80=A6=E2=80=
=9D This is a repetition, since it<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; is already mentioned in the previous paragraph.<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; p.6-7 The way crowdshared approaches and user-centric ap=
proaches<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; are defined right now is a little confusing, since they =
look really<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; similar. We can add some examples of each case to highli=
ght the<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; differences.<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; p.7 FON missing reference: <a href=3D"https://corp.fon.c=
om/en" target=3D"_blank">https://corp.fon.com/en</a><br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; p.8 The bullets that describe the actors in user-centric=
 networks<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; start abruptly. We should first add a sentence like =E2=
=80=9CThe actors<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; involved in a user-centric network are summarised below:=
=E2=80=9D<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; p.8 We should define ISP and ASP acronyms when we first =
use them.<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; p.8 We should rename Section 2.4 Testbeds to Testbeds fo=
r research<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; purposes to make it more clear.<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; p.8 Section 3.1 mostly describes developing countries an=
d digital<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; divide, not network deployment scenarios. For this reaso=
n, we could<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; rename this section =E2=80=9CDigital Divide=E2=80=9D. We=
 can also add a reference<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to the Digital Agenda Europe (<a href=3D"http://ec.europ=
a.eu/digital-agenda/" target=3D"_blank">http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/=
</a>)<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; p.11 We should add a reference to dwellers that share th=
e cost of<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the infrastructure ant the gateway and access it via ine=
xpensive<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; wireless devices.<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; p.11 We refer to scarce technical skills as a problem to=
 rural areas.<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; same problem exists in developing countries, as well.<br=
>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; p.11 There is no need for a subsection 4.1.1. since it i=
s the only one.<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; We<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; should re-write this paragraph more formally and move th=
e reference<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to the end of the document.<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; p.11 Add one more introductory sentence to Section 4.2. =
=E2=80=9CBelow we<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; summarise topics to be considered in such deployments.=
=E2=80=9D<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; p.11 We first refer to Fresnel zone in p.11, but we desc=
ribe it in p.12.<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; This explanation should be moved here.<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; p.13 Section 4.2.2. Link Length could be further split i=
nto three<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; subsections: Line-of-Sight, Transmitted and Received Pow=

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Medium Access Protocol.<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; p.17 Section 4.2.3.2. GMS should be re-written like =E2=

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; been used in Alternative Networks as layer 2 option.=E2=
=80=9D and reference<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; should be moved to the end of the document.<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; p.19 When we refer to LEDBAT we can add the following tw=

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; publications that summarise some important LEDBAT issues=

Thanks Ermanno,

Should we also write more on TVWS - about geolocation databases and why
using proprietary databases may not be the right way forward to connect
rural areas in developing regions - and whether cognitive sensing could be
used because there is enough spectrum along with the spectrum masking
details etc?.

Or do you think it will be too much for this document..

Regards
Arjuna

> Community Networks*
>
>
>    Community Networks are large-scale, distributed, self-managed
>
>    networks sharing these characteristics:
>
>
>    - They are built and organized in a decentralized and open manner.
>
>
>    - They start and grow organically, they are open to participation
>
>    from everyone, sometimes agreeing to an open peering agreement.
>
>    Community members are directly contributing active network
>
>    infrastructure (not just passive infrastructure).
>
>
>    - Knowledge about building and maintaining the network and ownership
>
>    of the network itself is decentralized and open.  Community members
>
>    have an obvious and direct form of organizational control over the
>
>    overall operation of the network in their community (not just their
>
>    own participation in the network).
>
>
>    - The network CAN serve as a backhaul for providing a whole range of
>
>    services and applications, from completely free to even commercial
>
>    services.
>
>
>    Hardware and software used in community networks CAN be very diverse,
>
>    even inside one network.  A Community Network CAN have both wired and
>
>    wireless links.  The network CAN be managed by multiple routing
>
>    protocols or network topology management systems.
>
>
>    A definition of Free Network (which MAY be the same as Community
>
>    Network) is proposed by the Free Network Foundation (see
>
>    http://thefnf.org) as:
>
>
>    A free network equitably grants the following freedoms to all:
>
>
>    Freedom 0 - Freedom to communicate for any purpose, without
>
>    discrimination, interference, or interception.
>
>
>    Freedom 1 - The freedom to grow, improve, communicate across, and
>
>    connect to the whole network.
>
>
>    Freedom 2- The freedom to study, use, remix, and share any network
>
>    communication mechanisms, in their most reusable forms."
>
>
>    The principles of these networks have also been summarized (see
>
>    http://guifi.net/ca/CXOLN) this way:
>
>
>    - You have the freedom to use the network for any purpose as long as

>
>    network segments can support multiple nodes and adopt the same

>    overall characteristics as those of the joined network, including the
>

>
>    joined to the network, there is no longer a meaningful distinction
>
>    between the previous extent of the network and the new extent of the
>
>    network.  In that sense, Community Networks can be called "user-
>
>    extensible networks".
>
>
>    These networks are also called sometimes "Free Networks" or even

<p dir=3D"ltr">Thanks Ermanno,</p>
<p dir=3D"ltr">Should we also write more on TVWS - about geolocation databa=

 connect rural areas in developing regions - and whether cognitive sensing =
could be used because there is enough spectrum along with the spectrum mask=

<p>Abstract</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 This document presents a taxonomy of &quot;alternative netw=
ork</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 deployments&quot;, and a set of definitions and shared char=
acteristics.</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 This term includes a set of network models emerged in the l=
ast</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 decades with the aim of bringing Internet connectivity to p=
eople,</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 following topological, architectural and business models di=
fferent</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 from the so-called &quot;traditional&quot; ones, where a co=
mpany deploys the</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 infrastructure connecting the households of the users, who =
pay for</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 it.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 Several initiatives throughout the World have built large s=
cale</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 networks that use wireless technologies (including long dis=
tance) due</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 to the reduced cost of using the unlicensed spectrum.=C2=A0=
 Others rely on</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 wired technologies.=C2=A0 Some of these networks are self-o=
rganized and</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 decentralized, other ones are based on sharing wireless res=
ources of</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 the users.=C2=A0 The emergence of these networks can be mot=
ivated by</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 different causes: Sometimes the reluctance, or the impossib=
ility, of</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 network operators to provide wired and cellular infrastruct=
ures to</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 rural/remote areas.=C2=A0 In these cases, the networks have=
 self</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 sustainable business models that provide more localised com=
munication</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 services as well as providing Internet backhaul support thr=
ough</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 peering agreements with traditional network operators.=C2=
=A0 Some other</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 times, they are built as a complement and an alternative to=
</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 commercial Internet access provided by &quot;traditional&qu=

<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 The classification considers different existing network mod=
els as</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 e.g., community networks, open wireless services, user-exte=
nsible</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 services, traditional local ISPs, new global ISPs, etc.=C2=
=A0 Different</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 criteria are used in order to build a classification as e.g=
., the</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 ownership of the equipment, the way the network is organize=
d, the</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 participatory model, the extensibility, if they are driven =
by a</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 community, a company or a local (public or private) stakeho=
lder, etc.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 According to the developed taxonomy, a characterization of =
each kind</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 of network is presented, in terms of network characteristic=
s related</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 to architecture, organization, etc.</p>

<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 When using an omnidirectional antenna outdoors to provide</=

<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 connectivity to a large area, people often select high gain=
 antennas</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 located at the highest structure available to extend the co=
verage.</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 In many cases this is counterproductive, since a high gain<=
/p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 omnidirectional antenna will have a very narrow beamwidth i=
n the</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 vertical plane, meaning that clients that are below the pla=
ne of the</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 antenna will receive a very weak signal (and by the recipro=
city</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 property of all antennas, the omni will also receive a feeb=
le signal</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 from the client).=C2=A0 So a moderate gain omnidirectional =
of about 8 to</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 10 dBi is normally preferable.=C2=A0 Higher gain omnis ante=
nnas are only</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 advisable when the farthest way client are roughly in the s=

<p><br></p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 For indoor clients, omnis are generally fine, because the n=

<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 reflections normally found in indoor environments negate th=

<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 Despite the fact that the free space loss is directly propo=

<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 frequencies for point to point links when there is a clear =
line of</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 sight, because it is <span>normally</span> easier to get hi=

<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 5 GHz.=C2=A0 Deploying high gain antennas at both ends will=
 more than</p>

<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 frequencies can make <span>do</span> with lower altitude an=

<p><br></p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 On the contrary, lower frequencies offer advantages when th=

<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 It is common to find dual radio Access Points, at two diffe=

<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 Of course, in the case of mesh networking, where the antenn=

<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 antennas.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 Keep also in mind that the same type of polarisation must b=

<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 both ends of any radio link.=C2=A0 For point to point links=
, some vendor</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 use two radios operating at the same frequency but with ort=

<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 offering added protection to multipath and other transmissi=

<p><br></p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 For short distance transmission, there is no strict require=
ment of</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 line of sight between the transmitter and the receiver, and=
 multipath</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 can guarantee communication despite the existence of obstac=
les in the</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 direct path.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 For longer distances, the first requirement is the existenc=
e of an</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 unobstructed line of sight between the transmitter and the =
receiver.</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 For very long path the earth curvature is an obstacle that =
must be</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 cleared, but the trajectory of the radio beam is not strict=
ly a</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 straight line due to the bending of the rays as a consequen=
ce of non-</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 uniformities of the atmosphere.=C2=A0 Most of the time this=
 bending will</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 mean that the radio horizon extends further than the optica=
l horizon.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 Another factor to be considered is that radio waves <span>o=
ccupy</span> a volume</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 around the optical line, which must be unencumbered from ob=
stacles</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 for the maximum signal to be captured at the receiver.=C2=
=A0 This volume</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 is known as the Fresnel ellipsoid and its size grows with t=
he</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 distance between the end points and with the wavelength of =
the</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 signal, which in turn is inversely proportional to the freq=
uency.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 So, for optimum signal reception the end points must be hig=
h enough</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 to clear any obstacle in the path and leave extra &quot;elb=
ow room&quot; for</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 the Fresnel zone.=C2=A0 This can be achieved by using suita=
ble masts at</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 either end, or by taking advantage of existing structures o=
r hills.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 Once a clear radio-electric line of sight (including the Fr=
esnel zone</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 clearance) is obtained, one must ascertain that the receive=
d power is</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 well above the sensitivity of the receiver, by what is know=
n as the</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 link margin.=C2=A0 The greater the link margin, the more re=
liable the</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 link.=C2=A0 For mission critical applications 20 dB margin =
is suggested,</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 but for non critical ones 10 dB might suffice.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 Bear in mind that the sensitivity of the receiver decreases=
 with the</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 transmission speed, so more power is needed at greater tran=
smission</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 speeds.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 The received power is determined by the transmitted power, =
the gain</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 of the transmitting and receiving antennas and the propagat=
ion loss.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 The propagation loss is the sum of the free space loss (pro=
portional</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 to the square of the the frequency and the square of the di=
stance),</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 plus additional factors like attenuation in the atmosphere =
by gases</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 or meteorological effects (which are strongly frequency dep=
endent),</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 multipath and diffraction losses.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 Multipath is more pronounced in trajectories over water, if=
 they</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 cannot be avoided special countermeasures should be taken.<=
/p>
<p><br></p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 So to achieve a given link margin (also called fade margin)=
, one can:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 a) increase the output power. The maximum transmitted power=
 is</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 specified by the country&#39;s regulation, and for unlicens=
ed frequencies</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 is much lower than for licensed frequencies.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 b) Increase the antenna gain.=C2=A0 There is no limit in th=
e gain of the</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 receiving antenna, but high gain antennas are bulkier, pres=
ent more</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 wind resistance and require sturdy mounts to comply with ti=
ghter</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 alignment requirements.=C2=A0 The transmitter antenna gain =
is also</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 regulated and can be different for point to point as for po=
int to</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 multipoint links.=C2=A0 Many countries impose a limit in th=
e combination</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 of transmitted power and antenna gain, the EIRP (Equivalent=
</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 Isotropically Irradiated Power) which can be different for =
point to</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 point or point to multipoint links.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 c) Reduce the propagation loss, by using a more favourable =
frequency</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 or a shorter path.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 d) Use a more sensitive receiver.=C2=A0 Receiver sensitivit=
y can be</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 improved by using better circuits, but it is ultimately lim=
ited by</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 the thermal noise, which is proportional to temperature and=
</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 bandwidth.=C2=A0 So one can increase the sensitivity by usi=
ng a smaller</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 receiving bandwidth, or by settling to lower throughput eve=
n in the</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 same receiver bandwidth.=C2=A0 This step is often done auto=
matically in</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 many protocols, in which the transmission speed can be redu=
ced say</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 from 150 Mbit/s to 6 Mbit/s if the receiver power is not en=
ough to</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 sustain the maximum throughput.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 A completely different limiting factor is related with the =
medium</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 access protocol.=C2=A0 WiFi was designed for short distance=
, and the</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 transmitter expects the reception of an acknowledgment for =
each</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 transmitted packet in a certain amount of time, if the wait=
ing time</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 is exceeded, the packet is retransmitted.=C2=A0 This will r=

<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 significantly the throughput at long distance, so for long =
distance</p>
<p>=C2=A0=C2=A0 application it is better to use a different medium access t=

Ermanno, thanks a lot for the feedback!.
=20
If everyone agrees, we can discuss the "Alternative Network Deployments" =
draft in the list for two more weeks, and then we could try to write a =
new version of the draft during the week 24th-28th November.

Thanks Ermanno,
Should we also write more on TVWS - about geolocation databases and why =
using proprietary databases may not be the right way forward to connect =
rural areas in developing regions - and whether cognitive sensing could =
be used because there is enough spectrum along with the spectrum masking =
details etc?.
Or do you think it will be too much for this document..
Regards
Arjuna

    Alternative Network Deployments.  Taxonomy and characterization
               draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01
=20
Abstract
=20
   This document presents a taxonomy of "alternative network
   deployments", and a set of definitions and shared characteristics.
   This term includes a set of network models emerged in the last
   decades with the aim of bringing Internet connectivity to people,
   following topological, architectural and business models different
   from the so-called "traditional" ones, where a company deploys the
   infrastructure connecting the households of the users, who pay for
   it.
=20
   Several initiatives throughout the World have built large scale
   networks that use wireless technologies (including long distance) due
   to the reduced cost of using the unlicensed spectrum.  Others rely on
   wired technologies.  Some of these networks are self-organized and
   decentralized, other ones are based on sharing wireless resources of
   the users.  The emergence of these networks can be motivated by
   different causes: Sometimes the reluctance, or the impossibility, of
   network operators to provide wired and cellular infrastructures to
   rural/remote areas.  In these cases, the networks have self
   sustainable business models that provide more localised communication
   services as well as providing Internet backhaul support through
   peering agreements with traditional network operators.  Some other
   times, they are built as a complement and an alternative to
   commercial Internet access provided by "traditional" network
   operators.

   The classification considers different existing network models as
   e.g., community networks, open wireless services, user-extensible
   services, traditional local ISPs, new global ISPs, etc.  Different
   criteria are used in order to build a classification as e.g., the
   ownership of the equipment, the way the network is organized, the
   participatory model, the extensibility, if they are driven by a
   community, a company or a local (public or private) stakeholder, etc.
=20
   According to the developed taxonomy, a characterization of each kind
   of network is presented, in terms of network characteristics related
   to architecture, organization, etc.

   Several initiatives throughout the World have built large scale
   networks that use wireless technologies (including long distance) due
   to the reduced cost of using the unlicensed spectrum.  Others rely on

   wired technologies.  Some of them are self-organized and
   decentralized, other ones are based on sharing wireless resources of
   the users.  The emergence of these networks can be motivated by
   different causes: Sometimes the reluctance, or the impossibility, of
   network operators to provide wired and cellular infrastructures to
   rural/remote areas [Pietrosemoli =
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#re=
f-Pietrosemoli> ].  In these cases, the networks have
   self sustainable business models that provide more localised
   communication services as well as providing Internet backhaul support
   through peering agreements with traditional network operators.  Some
   other times, they are built as a complement and an alternative to
   commercial Internet access provided by "traditional" network
   operators.
=20
   One of the aims of the Global Access to the Internet for All (GAIA)
   IRTF initiative is "to document and share deployment experiences and
   research results to the wider community through scholarly
   publications, white papers, Informational and Experimental RFCs,
   etc."  In line with this objective this document is intended to
   propose a classification of these "alternative network deployments".
   This term includes a set of network models emerged in the last
   decades with the aim of bringing Internet connectivity to people,
   following topological, architectural and business models different
   from the so-called "traditional" ones, where a company deploys the
   infrastructure connecting the households of the users, who pay for
   it.  The document is intended to be largely descriptive providing a
   broad overview of initiatives, technologies and approaches employed
   in these networks.  Research references describing each kind of
   network are also provided.

=20
   This section classifies Alternative Networks according to their
   intended usage.  Each of them have different incentive structures,
   maybe common technological challenges, but most importantly
   interesting usage challenges which feeds into the incentives as well
   as technological challenges.
=20
   This classification is agnostic from the technical point of view.
   Technology in this case must be taken as implementation.  Moreover,
   many of these networks are implemented in a way that several
   technologies (Ad-Hoc WiFi, Infrastructure WiFi, Optical Fibre, IPv4,
   IPv6, RFC1918 <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918> , OLSR, BMX6, =
etc.) coexist.

ction-2.1> 2.1.  Community Networks
=20
   Community Networks are large-scale, distributed, self-managed
   networks sharing these characteristics:
=20
   - They are built and organized in a decentralized and open manner.
=20
   - They start and grow organically, they are open to participation
   from everyone, sometimes agreeing to an open peering agreement.
   Community members are directly contributing active network
   infrastructure (not just passive infrastructure).
=20
   - Knowledge about building and maintaining the network and ownership
   of the network itself is decentralized and open.  Community members
   have an obvious and direct form of organizational control over the
   overall operation of the network in their community (not just their
   own participation in the network).
=20
   - The network CAN serve as a backhaul for providing a whole range of
   services and applications, from completely free to even commercial
   services.
=20
   Hardware and software used in community networks CAN be very diverse,
   even inside one network.  A Community Network CAN have both wired and
   wireless links.  The network CAN be managed by multiple routing
   protocols or network topology management systems.
=20
   A definition of Free Network (which MAY be the same as Community
   Network) is proposed by the Free Network Foundation (see
   http://thefnf.org <http://thefnf.org/> ) as:
=20
   A free network equitably grants the following freedoms to all:
=20
   Freedom 0 - Freedom to communicate for any purpose, without
   discrimination, interference, or interception.
=20
   Freedom 1 - The freedom to grow, improve, communicate across, and
   connect to the whole network.
=20
   Freedom 2- The freedom to study, use, remix, and share any network
   communication mechanisms, in their most reusable forms."
=20
   The principles of these networks have also been summarized (see
   http://guifi.net/ca/CXOLN) this way:
=20
   - You have the freedom to use the network for any purpose as long as
   you don't harm the operation of the network itself , the rights of

   other users, or the principles of neutrality that allow contents and
   services to flow without deliberate interference.
=20
   - You have the right to understand the network, to know its
   components, and to spread knowledge of its mechanisms and principles.
=20
   - You have the right to offer services and content to the network on
   your own terms.
=20
   - You have the right to join the network, and the responsibility to
   extend this set of rights to anyone according to these same terms.
=20
   These networks grow organically, since they are formed by the
   aggregation of nodes belonging to different users.  A minimum
   governance infrastructure is required in order to coordinate IP
   addressing, routing, etc.  A clear example of this kind of Community
   Network is described in [Braem =
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#re=
f-Braem> ].  These networks are effective in
   enhancing and extending digital Internet rights following a
   participatory model.
=20
   The fact of the users adding new infrastructure can be used to build
   another definition: A network in which any participant in the system
   may add link segments to the network in such a way that the new
   network segments can support multiple nodes and adopt the same
   overall characteristics as those of the joined network, including the
   capacity to further extend the network.  Once these link segments are
   joined to the network, there is no longer a meaningful distinction
   between the previous extent of the network and the new extent of the
   network.  In that sense, Community Networks can be called "user-
   extensible networks".
=20
   These networks are also called sometimes "Free Networks" or even
   "Network Commons".  However, the most accepted name is Community
   Networks.
=20
   In Community Networks, the profit can only be made by services and
   not by the infrastructure itself, because the infrastructure is
   neutral, free, and open (traditional ISPs base their business on the
   control of the infrastructure).  In Community Networks, everybody
   keeps the ownership of what he/she has contributed.

=20
   These networks follow the following approach: the home router creates =
two
   wireless networks, one of them to be normally used by the owner, and
   the other one is public.  A small fraction of the bandwidth is
   allocated to the public network (as e.g.  Less-than-best-effort or

   scavenger traffic), to be employed by any user of the service in the
   immediate area.  An example is described in [PAWS =
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#re=
f-PAWS> ].
=20
   A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is created for public traffic, so it
   is completely secure and separated from the owner's connection.  The
   network capacity shared may employ a less-than-best-effort approach,
   so as not to harm the traffic of the owner of the connection
   [Sathiaseelan_a =
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#re=
f-Sathiaseelan_a> ].
=20
   There are three actors in the scenario:
=20
   - End users who sign up for the service and share their network
   capacity.  As a counterpart, they can access anyone's home broadband
   for free.
=20
   - Virtual Network Operators (VNOs) are stakeholders with socio-
   environmental objectives.  They can be a local government, grass root
   user communities, charities, or even content operators, smart grid
   operators, etc.  They are the ones who actually run the service.
=20
   - Network operators, who have a financial incentive to lease out the
   unused capacity [Sathiaseelan_b =
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#re=
f-Sathiaseelan_b> ] at lower cost to the VNOs.
=20
   VNOs pay the sharers and the network operators, thus creating an
   incentive structure for all the actors: the end users get money for
   sharing their network, the network operators are paid by the VNOs,
   who in turn accomplish their socio-environmental role.

=20
   A first example is constituted by the networks created and managed by =
City Councils
   (e.g., [Heer =
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#re=
f-Heer> ]).  Some companies [FON reference missing] develop and
   sell Wi-Fi routers with a dual access: a Wi-Fi network for the user,
   and a shared one.  A user community is created, an people can join it
   different ways: they can buy a dual router, so they share their
   connection and in turn they get access to all the routers associated
   to the community.  Some users can even get some revenues every time
   another user connects to their Wi-Fi spot.  Other users can just buy
   some passes in order to use the network.  Some telecommunications
   operators can collaborate with the community, including in their
   routers the possibility of creating these two networks.
=20
   These networks can be defined as a set of nodes whose owners share
   common interests (e.g. sharing connectivity; resources; peripherals)
   regardless of their physical location.  The node location exhibits a
   space and time correlation which is the basis to establish a robust
   connectivity model over time.

   - "Interest": a parameter capable of providing a measure (cost) of
   the attractiveness of a node towards a specific location, in a
   specific instant in time.
=20
   - The owner: an entity (e.g. end-user; operator; virtual operator;
   municipality) that is to be made responsible for any actions
   concerning his/her device.
=20
   - The user: a legal entity or an individual using or requesting a
   publicly available electronic communications' service for private or
   business purposes, without necessarily having subscribed to such
   service.
=20
   - Resources: A physical or virtual element of a global system.  For
   instance, bandwdith; energy; data; devices.
=20
   - The Virtual Operator: entity that acts in some aspects as a network
   coordinator.  It may provide services such as initial authentication
   or registering, and eventually, trust relationship storage.  A VO is
   not an ISP given that it does not provide Internet access (e.g.
   infrastructure; naming).  A VO is neither an ASP since it does not
   provide user services.

   Alternative Network Deployments are present in every part of the
   World.  Even in some high-income countries, these networks have been
   built as an alternative to commercial ones managed by traditional
   network operators.  This section discusses the scenarios where
   alternative networks are interesting or have been deployed.

each country
=20
   There is no definition for what a developing country represents that
   has been recognized internationally, but the term is generally used
   to describe a nation with a low level of material well-being.  In
   this sense, one of the most commonly used classification is the one
   by the World Bank, who ranks countries according to their Gross
   National Income (GNI) per Capita: low income, middle income, and high
   income, being those falling within the low and middle income groups
   considered developing economies.  Developing countries have been also
   defined as those which are in transition from traditional lifestyles

   towards the modern lifestyle which began in the Industrial
   Revolution.  Additionally, the Human Development Index, which
   considers not only the GNI but also life expectancy and education,
   has been proposed by the United Nations to rank countries according
   to the well-being of a country and not solely based on economic
   terms.  These classifications are used to give strong signals to the
   international community to the need of special concessions in support
   of these countries, implying a correlation between development and
   increased well-being.
=20
   However, at the beginning of the 90's the debates about how to
   quantify development in a country were shaken by the appearance of
   Internet and mobile phones, which many authors consider the beginning
   of the Information Society.  With the beginning of this Digital
   Revolution, defining development based on Industrial Society concepts
   started to be challenged, and links between digital development and
   its impact on human development started to flourish.  The following
   dimensions are considered to be meaningful when measuring the digital
   development state of a country: infrastructures (availability and
   affordability); ICT sector (human capital and technological
   industry); digital literacy; legal and regulatory framework; and
   content and services.  The lack or less extent of digital development
   in one or more of these dimensions is what has been referred as
   Digital Divide.  This divide is a new vector of inequality which - as
   it happened during the Industrial Revolution - generates a lot of
   progress at the expense of creating a lot economic poverty and
   exclusion.  The Digital Divide is considered to be a consequence of
   other socio-economic divides, while, at the same time, a reason for
   their rise.
=20
   In this context, the so-called "developing countries", worried of
   being left behind of this incipient digital revolution, motivated the
   World Summit of the Information Society which aimed at achieving "a
   people-centred, inclusive and development-oriented Information
   Society, where everyone can create, access, utilize and share
   information and knowledge, enabling individuals, communities and
   peoples to achieve their full potential in promoting their
   sustainable development and improving their quality of life" [WSIS =
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#re=
f-WSIS> ],
   and called upon "governments, private sector, civil society and
   international organisations" to actively engage to accomplish it
   [WSIS =

   problem, some governments included Universal Service and Access
   obligations to mobile network operators when liberalizing the
   telecommunications market.  In combination with the overwhelming and
   unexpected uptake of mobile phones by poor people, this has mitigated
   the low access indicators existing in many developing countries at
   the beginning of the 90s [Rendon =
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#re=
f-Rendon> ].
=20
   Although it is undeniable the contribution made by mobile network
   operators in decreasing the access gap, their model presents some
   constraints that limits the development outcomes that increased
   connectivity promises to bring.  Prices, tailored for the more
   affluent part of the population, remain unaffordable to many, who
   invest large percentages of their disposable income in
   communications.  Additionally, the cost of prepaid packages, the only
   option available for the informal economies existing throughout
   developing countries, is high compared with the rate longer-term
   subscribers pay.
=20
   The consolidation of many Alternative Networks (e.g.  Community
   Networks) in high income countries sets a precedent for civil society
   members from the so-called developing countries to become more active
   in the search for alternatives to provide themselves with affordable
   access.  Furthermore, Alternative Networks could contribute to other
   dimensions of the digital development like increased human capital
   and the creation of contents and services targeting the locality of
   each network.

=20
   The Digital Divide presented in the previous section is not only
   present between countries, but within them too.  This is specially
   the case for rural inhabitants, which represents approximately 55% of
   the World's population, from which 78% inhabit in developing
   countries.  Although it is impossible to generalize among them, there
   exist some common features that have determined the availability of
   ICT infrastructure in these regions.  The disposable income of their
   dwellers is lower than those inhabiting urban areas, with many
   surviving on a subsistence economy.  Many of them are located in
   geographies difficult to access and exposed to extreme weather
   conditions.  This has resulted in the almost complete lack of
   electrical infrastructure.  This context, together with their low
   population density, discourages telecommunications operators to
   provide similar services to those provided to urban dwellers, since
   they do not deem them profitable
=20
   The cost of the wireless infrastructure required to set up a network,
   including powering them via solar energy, is within the range of
   availability if not of individuals at least of entire communities.

   The social capital existing in these areas can allow for Alternative
   Network set-ups where a reduced number of nodes may cover communities
   whose dwellers share the cost of the infrastructure and the gateway
   and access it via inexpensive wireless devices.  In this case, the
   lack of awareness and confidence of rural communities to embark
   themselves in such tasks can become major barriers to their
   deployment.  Scarce technical skills in these regions have been also
   pointed as a challenge for their success, but the proliferation of
   urban Community Networks, where scarcity of spectrum, scale, and
   heterogeneity of devices pose tremendous challenges to their
   stability and to that of the services they aim to provide, has
   fuelled the creation of robust low-cost low-consumption low-
   complexity off-the-self wireless devices which make much easier the
   deployment and maintenance of these alternative infrastructures in
   rural areas.

   For local access, omnidirectional antennas are the most useful, since
   they provide the same coverage in all directions of the plane in
   which they are located.  Above and below this plane, the received
   signal will diminish, so the maximum benefits are obtained when the
   client is at approximately the same height as the Access Point.

=20
   When using an omnidirectional antenna outdoors to provide
   connectivity to a large area, people often select high gain antennas
   located at the highest structure available to extend the coverage.
   In many cases this is counterproductive, since a high gain
   omnidirectional antenna will have a very narrow beamwidth in the
   vertical plane, meaning that clients that are below the plane of the
   antenna will receive a very weak signal (and by the reciprocity
   property of all antennas, the omni will also receive a feeble signal
   from the client).  So a moderate gain omnidirectional of about 8 to
   10 dBi is normally preferable.  Higher gain omnis antennas are only
   advisable when the farthest way client are roughly in the same plane.
=20
   For indoor clients, omnis are generally fine, because the numerous
   reflections normally found in indoor environments negate the
   advantage of using directive antennas.
=20
   For outdoor clients, directive antennas can be quite useful to extend
   coverage to an Access Point fitted with an omni.
=20
   When building point to point links, the highest gain antennas are the
   best choice, since their narrow beamwidth mitigates interference from
   other users and can provide the longest links [Flickenger =
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#re=
f-Flickenger> ] [Zennaro =
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#re=
f-Zennaro> ].
=20
   24 to 34 dBi antennas are commercially available at both the
   unlicensed 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands, and even higher gain antennas can
   be found in the newer unlicensed bands at 17 GHz and 24 GHz.
=20
   Despite the fact that the free space loss is directly proportional to
   the square of the frequency, it is normally advisable to use higher
   frequencies for point to point links when there is a clear line of
   sight, because it is normally easier to get higher gain antennas at
   5 GHz.  Deploying high gain antennas at both ends will more than
   compensate for the additional free space loss.  Furthermore, higher
   frequencies can make do with lower altitude antenna placement since
   the Fresnel zone is inversely proportional to the square root of the
   frequency.
=20
   On the contrary, lower frequencies offer advantages when the line of
   sight is blocked because they can leverage diffraction to reach the
   intended receiver.
=20
   It is common to find dual radio Access Points, at two different
   frequency bands.  One way of benefiting from this arrangement is to
   attach a directional antenna to the high frequency radio for
   connection to the backbone and an omni to the lower frequency to
   provide local access.

=20
   Of course, in the case of mesh networking, where the antenna should
   connect to several other nodes, it is better to use omnidirectional
   antennas.
=20
   Keep also in mind that the same type of polarisation must be used at
   both ends of any radio link.  For point to point links, some vendor
   use two radios operating at the same frequency but with orthogonal
   polarisations, thus doubling the achievable throughput, and also
   offering added protection to multipath and other transmission
   impairments.

ction-4.2.2> 4.2.2.  Link length
=20
   For short distance transmission, there is no strict requirement of
   line of sight between the transmitter and the receiver, and multipath
   can guarantee communication despite the existence of obstacles in the
   direct path.
=20
   For longer distances, the first requirement is the existence of an
   unobstructed line of sight between the transmitter and the receiver.
   For very long path the earth curvature is an obstacle that must be
   cleared, but the trajectory of the radio beam is not strictly a
   straight line due to the bending of the rays as a consequence of non-
   uniformities of the atmosphere.  Most of the time this bending will
   mean that the radio horizon extends further than the optical horizon.
=20
   Another factor to be considered is that radio waves occupy a volume
   around the optical line, which must be unencumbered from obstacles
   for the maximum signal to be captured at the receiver.  This volume
   is known as the Fresnel ellipsoid and its size grows with the
   distance between the end points and with the wavelength of the
   signal, which in turn is inversely proportional to the frequency.
=20
   So, for optimum signal reception the end points must be high enough
   to clear any obstacle in the path and leave extra "elbow room" for
   the Fresnel zone.  This can be achieved by using suitable masts at
   either end, or by taking advantage of existing structures or hills.
=20
   Once a clear radio-electric line of sight (including the Fresnel zone
   clearance) is obtained, one must ascertain that the received power is
   well above the sensitivity of the receiver, by what is known as the
   link margin.  The greater the link margin, the more reliable the
   link.  For mission critical applications 20 dB margin is suggested,
   but for non critical ones 10 dB might suffice.
=20
   Bear in mind that the sensitivity of the receiver decreases with the
   transmission speed, so more power is needed at greater transmission
   speeds.

Internet-Draft       Alternative Network Deployments        October 2014
=20
=20
   The received power is determined by the transmitted power, the gain
   of the transmitting and receiving antennas and the propagation loss.
=20
   The propagation loss is the sum of the free space loss (proportional
   to the square of the the frequency and the square of the distance),
   plus additional factors like attenuation in the atmosphere by gases
   or meteorological effects (which are strongly frequency dependent),
   multipath and diffraction losses.
=20
   Multipath is more pronounced in trajectories over water, if they
   cannot be avoided special countermeasures should be taken.
=20
   So to achieve a given link margin (also called fade margin), one can:
=20
   a) increase the output power. The maximum transmitted power is
   specified by the country's regulation, and for unlicensed frequencies
   is much lower than for licensed frequencies.
=20
   b) Increase the antenna gain.  There is no limit in the gain of the
   receiving antenna, but high gain antennas are bulkier, present more
   wind resistance and require sturdy mounts to comply with tighter
   alignment requirements.  The transmitter antenna gain is also
   regulated and can be different for point to point as for point to
   multipoint links.  Many countries impose a limit in the combination
   of transmitted power and antenna gain, the EIRP (Equivalent
   Isotropically Irradiated Power) which can be different for point to
   point or point to multipoint links.
=20
   c) Reduce the propagation loss, by using a more favourable frequency
   or a shorter path.
=20
   d) Use a more sensitive receiver.  Receiver sensitivity can be
   improved by using better circuits, but it is ultimately limited by
   the thermal noise, which is proportional to temperature and
   bandwidth.  So one can increase the sensitivity by using a smaller
   receiving bandwidth, or by settling to lower throughput even in the
   same receiver bandwidth.  This step is often done automatically in
   many protocols, in which the transmission speed can be reduced say
   from 150 Mbit/s to 6 Mbit/s if the receiver power is not enough to
   sustain the maximum throughput.
=20
   A completely different limiting factor is related with the medium
   access protocol.  WiFi was designed for short distance, and the
   transmitter expects the reception of an acknowledgment for each
   transmitted packet in a certain amount of time, if the waiting time
   is exceeded, the packet is retransmitted.  This will reduce
   significantly the throughput at long distance, so for long distance
   application it is better to use a different medium access technique,

   in which the receiver does not wait for an acknowledgement of the
   transited packet.  This strategy of TDMA (Time Domain Multiple
   Access) has been adopted by many equipment vendors who offer
   proprietary protocols alongside the standard WiFi in order to
   increase the throughput at longer distances.  Low cost equipment
   using TDMA can offer high throughput at distances over 100

networks
=20
   Before packets can be forwarded and routed to the Internet, layers
   one (the physical) and two (the data link) need to be connected.
   Without link local connectivity, network nodes cannot talk to each
   other and route packets.
=20
   To provide physical connectivity, wireless network devices must
   operate in the same part of the radio spectrum.  This means that
   802.11a radios will talk to 802.11a radios at around 5 GHz, and
   802.11b/g radios will talk to other 802.11b/g radios at around 2.4
   GHz.  But an 802.11a device cannot interoperate with an 802.11b/g
   device, since they use completely different parts of the
   electromagnetic spectrum.  More specifically, wireless interfaces
   must agree on a common channel.  If one 802.11b radio card is set to
   channel 2 while another is set to channel 11, then the radios cannot
   communicate with each other.
=20
   When two wireless interfaces are configured to use the same protocol
   on the same radio channel, then they are ready to negotiate data link
   layer connectivity.  Each 802.11a/b/g device can operate in one of
   four possible modes:
=20
   1.Master mode (also called AP or infrastructure mode) is used to
   create a service that looks like a traditional access point.  The
   wireless interface creates a network with a specified name (called
   the SSID) and channel, and offers network services on it.  While in
   master mode, wireless interfaces manage all communications related to
   the network (authenticating wireless clients, handling channel
   contention, repeating packets, etc.)  Wireless interfaces in master
   mode can only communicate with interfaces that are associated with
   them in managed mode.
=20
   2.Managed mode is sometimes also referred to as client mode.
   Wireless interfaces in managed mode will join a network created by a
   master, and will automatically change their channel to match it.
   They then present any necessary credentials to the master, and if
   those credentials are accepted, they are said to be associated with
   the master.  Managed mode interfaces do not communicate with each
   other directly, and will only communicate with an associated master.
=20
   3.Ad-hoc mode creates a multipoint-to-multipoint network where there
   is no single master node or AP.  In ad-hoc mode, each wireless
   interface communicates directly with its neighbours.  Nodes must be
   in range of each other to communicate, and must agree on a network
   name and channel.  Ad-hoc mode is often also called Mesh Networking.

   4.Monitor mode is used by some tools (such as Kismet) to passively
   listen to all radio traffic on a given channel.  When in monitor =
mode,
   wireless interfaces transmit no data.  This is useful for analysing
   problems on a wireless link or observing spectrum usage in the local
   area.  Monitor mode is not used for normal communications.
=20
   When implementing a point-to-point or point-to-multipoint link, one
   radio will typically operate in master mode, while the other(s)
   operate in managed mode.  In a multipoint-to-multipoint mesh, the
   radios all operate in ad-hoc mode so that they can communicate with
   each other directly.  Remember that managed mode clients cannot
   communicate with each other directly, so it is likely that you will
   want to run a high repeater site in master or ad-hoc mode.  Ad-hoc is
   more flexible but has a number of performance issues as compared to
   using the master / managed modes.

   These networks are composed of possibly different layer 2 devices,
   resulting in a mesh of nodes.  Connection between different nodes is
   not guaranteed, the link stability can vary strongly over time.  To
   tackle this, some Community Networks use mesh network routing
   protocols while other networks use more traditional routing
   protocols.  Some networks operate multiple routing protocols in
   parallel.  E.g., they use a mesh protocol inside different islands
   and use traditional routing protocols to connect islands.

   sharer side and from the client side.  From sharer's side, there are
   applications to centralise the management of the APs conforming the
   network that have been recently proposed by means of SDN
   [Sathiaseelan_a =
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#re=
f-Sathiaseelan_a> ]  [Suresh =
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#re=
f-Suresh> ].  There are also other proposals such as
   Wi2Me [Lampropulos =
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#re=
f-Lampropulos> ] that manage the connection to several Community
   Networks from the client's side.  This application have shown to
   improve the client performance compared to a single-Community Network
   client.
=20
   On the other hand, transport protocols inside a multiple hop wireless
   mesh network are likely to suffer performance degradation for
   multiple reasons, e.g., hidden terminal problem, unnecessary delays
   on the TCP ACK clocking that decrease the throughout or route
   changing [Hanbali =
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#re=
f-Hanbali> ].  So, there are some options for network
   configuration.  The implementation of an easy-to-adopt solution for
   TCP over mesh networks may be implemented from two different
   perspectives.  One way is to use a TCP-proxy to transparently deal
   with the different impairments RFC 3135 =
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3135>  [RFC3135 =
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3135> ].  Another way is to
   adopt end-to-end solutions for monitoring the connection delay so
   that the receiver adapts the TCP reception window (rwnd)
   [Castignani_c =
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#re=
f-Castignani_c> ].  Similarly, the ACK Congestion Control (ACKCC)
   mechanism RFC 5690 <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5690>  [RFC5690 =
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5690> ] could deal with TCP-ACK clocking
   impairments due to inappropriate delay on ACK packets.  ACKCC
   compensates in an end-to-end fashion the throughput degradation due
   to the effect of media contention as well as the unfairness
   experienced by multiple uplink TCP flows in a congested WiFi access.

   This section provides an explaining of the services between hosts
   inside the network.  They can be divided into Intranet services,
   connecting hosts between them, and Internet services, connecting to

=20
   These networks follow different topology patterns, as studied in
   [Vega =
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#re=
f-Vega> ].
=20
   Regularly rural areas in these networks are connected through long-
   distance links (the so-called community mesh approach) which in turn
   convey the Internet connection to relevant organisations or
   institutions.  In contrast, in urban areas, users tend to share and
   require mobile access.  Since these areas are also likely to be
   covered by commercial ISPs, the provision of wireless access by
   Virtual Operators like FON is the way to extend the user capacity (or
   gain connection) to the network.  Other proposals like Virtual Public
   Networks [Sathiaseelan_a =
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#re=
f-Sathiaseelan_a> ] can also extend the service.
=20
   As in the case of main Internet Service Providers in France,
   Community Networks for urban areas are conceived as a set of APs
   sharing a common SSID among the clients favouring the nomadic access.
   For users in France, ISPs promise to cause a little impact on their
   service agreement when the shared network service is activated on
   clients' APs.  Nowadays, millions of APs are deployed around the
   country performing services of nomadism and 3G offloading, however as
   some studies demonstrate, at walking speed, there is a fair chance
   of performing file transfers [Castignani_a =
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#re=

   from different ISPs.  Moreover, performed studies reveal that =
aggregating=20
   available networks can be
   beneficial to the client by using an application that manage the best
   connection among the different networks.  For improving the scanning
   process (or topology recognition), which consumes the 90% of the
   connection/reconnection process to the Community Network, the client
   may implement several techniques for selecting the best AP

Interesting report from Sandvine.
https://www.sandvine.com/downloads/general/global-internet-phenomena/2014/1h-2014-global-internet-phenomena-report.pdf

This article focuses on African trends in the report
http://www.biztechafrica.com/article/sandvine-releases-african-internet-trend-data/9126/
  Highlights follow:

Mobile Networks:
- WhatsApp is the leading third-party messaging application, accounting for
7% of total traffic. In North America and Europe it accounts for less than
2% total traffic
- Viber has overtaken Skype as the leading VoIP service on several networks
- Streaming video accounts for just over 6% of downstream traffic, which is
significantly lower than North America and Europe where it accounts for
more than 30%
- WAP Browsing has seen a significant decline in traffic share thanks to
increased adoption of smartphones throughout the region

Fixed Networks:
- Streaming video is the leading source of downstream traffic (26%), but is
still significantly lower than most other world markets where it is
typically the majority of traffic YouTube is the top video streaming app,
accountable for 12.3% of downstream traffic P2P
- Filesharing still represents over 15% of  total fixed network traffic,
likely due to the lack of over-the-top streaming options and the poorer
streaming experience afforded by slower networks, compared to downloading
content to watch later

The WhatsApp data matches my recent experience in Ghana and evidence from
countries like Zimbabwe (
http://www.techzim.co.zw/2014/05/whatsapp-bundles-now-constitutes-23-of-activity-on-econets-network-since-bundles/).
By contrast, reading Safaricom's half-year report released last week, they
report an increase in SMS traffic, something I did not expect.
www.safaricom.co.ke/images/Downloads/Resources_Downloads/Half_Year_2014-2015_Results_Presentation.pdf

I think the prominence of YouTube is due in no small part to the strategic
deployment of Google Global Caches.

The growth of Viber probably matches the growth of mobile where Viber is
simply a better low-bandwidth app than Skype, but that is pure speculation.

Regards... Steve

Elon musk to launch microsatellites..

He says - cheap..how cheap? And what's the business plan to recuperate the
1 bn dollar investment?

Instead of each of the launching satellites, balloons and UAVs, why can't
google, internet.org, o3b, outernet, elon musk et al put in a collective
fund and launch a satellite network?

Probably all of us should get some collective funds and launch a GAIA
satellite network! :)

If it can support a billion users, the capital investment per person
is pretty minimal... The premise is obviously a big IF.

Viasat-2 (to be launched) costs $625M, with a service capacity of
roughy 1M, so the benchmark to beat is above $500/user.

It will be interesting to see if they go for the old Iridium LEO
model, trying to achieve continuous (voice) connectivity, or, with
data, allow for somewhat burstier connectivity, which might help lower
system complexity.

I don't know if the landscape changed in the last few years but: 
1) there is only one or two geo satellites covering the 20+ Pacific Islands countries (not enough people for a competitive market therefore cheap prices) 
2) each leo satellite company must negotiate "landing deals" or turn their signal off when they fly over some countries.

Hi Arjuna,



Could you please announce the following to the GAIA attendees:

1.       *Registration* to DEV 2014 and 3rd GAIA workshop is now open:
http://acmdev.org/registration/

a.       The early bird registration prices end on *November 21, 2014*.

2.       The cut-off date for availing the discounted rates at the conference
hotel <http://acmdev.org/venue> has been extended till *November 17, 2014*.
The organizers request the attendees to reserve the conference hotel at the
earliest since (1) the discounted rate is guaranteed only for a limited set
of blocked rooms and (2) the conference has a financial commitment
associated with the guestroom block.

a.       As there are several events happening in San Jose downtown during
December 1st week, the conference hotel may not even be available once the
blocked rooms are sold out.





Looking forward to GAIA + DEV-5 next month!





Thanks,

Krishnaram

(On behalf of the organizing committee)

Thanks Franck and Henning,

This is great info..

Would be interesting to build a planetlab type cubesat network for R&D
for ICTD if world bank can fund one :)..

Or if any of these organisations could virtualise their satellite
network and provide infrastructure for R&D (and research organisations
can fund the costs associated with it)..

just wild thoughts..

Regards
Arjuna

Hello Henning,
  this is based on LEO model - would be interesting to see the
capacity details because the cubesat model proposed in the ring road
idea by Scott Burleigh is pretty limited in capacity but may be
efficient for disaster relief/basic comms:
http://www.ipnsig.org/reports/RingRoad.pdf

So internet.org is zero rating some services in kenya..

The spooky and not nice part is it has removed google search which was
previously available in Tanzania and Zambia! The internet.org folks need to
understand this isn't about competition, its about working together to
alleviate and give a hand to lift those who are in need!

Hi all,

I would be curious to know exactly why Google search has been removed.
Interesting too is the inclusion of the classified serivce, OLX.  Jana have
an article explaining why they think it is an important app to include
http://www.jana.com/blog/why-internet-org-is-backing-olx/

For me, a more interesting approach to zero-rating would be to convince an
MNO to generically zero-rate 2G services.  This idea occurred to me when I
learned that T-Mobile offers free 2G roaming internationally to its
customers.

This would be a more egalitarian approach to zero-rating that would benefit
all content providers and give them an incentive to make their apps as slim
(data-consumption-wise) as possible.  I suspect that this would benefit
MNOs as well, who have likely already recouped their investments in 2G
networks, by spurring adoption of 3G access as more people begin to value
online services.  Governments could offer flat incentives to operators to
zero-rate 2G.

Regards... Steve

Hello Steve,
I really like the idea of zero rating 2g services - this is like giving a
Lower quality service for free under the assumption that this will spur
take up of higher quality (3g in your case) and brand loyality. With 5g in
the pipeline which will encompass all these technologies, this will be a
promising approach.

This was the premise of our lcdnet work here in cambridge too:
http://www.sigcomm.org/sites/default/files/ccr/papers/2013/April/2479957-2479966.pdf

I agree that the govt can provide incentives (reduction of tax? Future
spectrum licenses?). But would such a model be sustainable for MVNOs?

Regards

I think Steve's idea is interesting to explore - even only 2G speed, it
would possibly be of huge benefit to those without any access. On the other
hand, is there still a lot of 2G around? Perhaps critical mass of 2G in
places like India, and African countries? Worth looking at the data.

In addition, I'm wondering about the possibility of pricing models where
anything that's 'one-click-away' is also free (so FB-zero/Wiki-zero are
free, as are the first link outside these apps the user clicks on.  from
there if the users go to other URLs it's charged).  Would this at least
start addressing the 'lesser experience' of the internet that concern many
pro-net-neutrality folk? . But I don't know if this feasible ( to monitor
and enforce real time, from the billing point of view) for at telco.

Finally a request for help - we are trying to identify any real-world
examples of users converting to paying mobile internet consumers after
experience zero-rated content. Berin Szoka pointed to a specific example
from Turkey (with high conversion rate for users) at the panel on Net
Neutrality at this year's IGF (if you have energy, transcript for the
session at
http://www.intgovforum.org/cms/174-igf-2014/transcripts/1969-2014-09-03-ws208-net-neutrality-zero-rating-and-development-room-5)..
Do any members on this list know of other examples?   This is to set the
stage for a possible new research we are thinning of doing,  to look at the
evolution of users/user behaviour (pre-, during and post- their experience
with zero-rated content).

Best,

Given that spectrum is scarce in many countries, and 2G "refarming" seems
to be a common goal (given the much lower spectral efficiency of 2G
compared to 3G and 4G), I'm not sure this is anything but a very short term
strategy. If you really want to provide a low-grade "teaser" service, you
can just rate-limit the free service, similar to what (say) TMobile does
after you exceed your monthly bit budget. However, if you want to convert
people to using your paid service, making the trial experience really bad
doesn't seem like the most obvious way, but I'm not a marketing guy...

Hello Henning, all

 I think from an user experience point of view, I agree this may not
be a good experience. We wanted to understand this via our Public
Access WiFi Service project which was a limited socio-technological
study here in Nottingham, but we were not successful unfortunately
because of the vagaries of carrying out in the wild research and  from
a developed urban context where users have already perceived good
quality Internet access through other means (I will be presenting this
work at the ACM DEV next month:
http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~as2330/docs/dev12.pdf)

however it would be interesting to see how people in developing
regions perceive such a service? I see a free default lower quality
service (could also do by throttling as we did via PAWS or using 2G -
its interesting since in Australia and in the US, there are plans to
shut down 2G and repurpose it as you mentioned while in the developing
regions 80% of mobile connections are 2G) is no worse (infact better
in terms of user experience) than a zero rated service where you have
access to only a handful of sites or where access to the first-click
is free while for others you have to end up paying..

Infact I am wondering whether  an alternative model to repurposing 2G
would be  to create a new business model to connect the remaining
population by 2G for free and then the govt to subsidise the costs
associated with it (for reasons like this:
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/digital-by-default-proposed-for-government-services).
Would be good to know which way would be beneficial for the network
operators.

btw I saw this interesting 2G free VoIP call app which is paid through
by ads: http://www.amgoo.com/blog/android-app-that-promises-free-voice-calls-via-2g-say-hello-to-nanu

Regards

There seem to be five "entry level" approaches:

* 2G - short term solution, most likely, and not spectrally efficient; only
suited for small subset of (text-based) content and some low-bandwidth apps.

* 3G/4G with rate limiting - similar issues, but more flexible and
efficient than 2G, but probably better suited as a "bargain" or low-income
service to avoid cannibalizing other service offerings. (This is similar to
the Google "free" service or the EveryOneOn approach.)

* 3G/4G with limited data caps, such as the 250 MB "feature phone" plans.
This is similar to the US LifeLine model of a $9.25 government subsidy for
a limited bucket of voice minutes for eligible low-income consumers.

* zero-rating

* ad supported; unlikely that ads can support current bandwidth costs,
particularly since low-income consumers aren't likely to attract the
highest ad prices. (Zero-rating and ad-supported are obviously cousins.)

Plus, there are hybrid models where cellular only serves as basic
connectivity for messaging, maps and such, and Wi-Fi in public or other
places is used for side-loading high-volume data. Various people (including
my research group) have proposed mobility-based data transport
("delay-tolerant networking", "data couriers", etc.), using existing public
or private vehicles, such as buses and taxis. This can work if there's a
rural-urban divide in bandwidth availability.

Helani asked:
>is there still a lot of 2G around?

I believe that there is still a lot of 2G around in the kinds of places
where zero-rating is important. As a single data point, I recently found
out that about 3/4 of the coverage area in Liberia is 2G-only.  Certainly
where I lived in Democratic Republic of Congo (South Kivu and Bandundu
provinces) was 2G-only; 3G was only available in the regional capitals.
Many of these places are already uplink-constrained at 2G, so turning on 3G
doesn't necessarily accomplish anything.

Thanks,
-rohan

This is fantastic, except that the coverage area is exactly backwards for
their target user base. They are starting with coverage in North America
and Western Europe first.

Rohan
thats so true- kind of limits the scope and benefits of the project in some
way

two options
a) contact the lantern folks, asking for a more even geographical spread
from the start (and provide a collaboration option for the same)
b)start a parallel op either in collaboration with them, or independently

I take the opportunity to report that (following an earlier exchange on
this list) eventually  meet AirJaldi team in Dharamshala India recently
(and had a great walk around with Jim Forster) with a view to get rural
wireless broadband in a portion of the Himalayas that they cover :-)  I am
working to see more  'social enterprise' economic/business models for ISPs,
such as users/customers should be able to buy preferential shares in the
business etc.

Hello Rohan

I presume its because thats where they can start trialling, easier to
bootstrap from the  funding perspective?

Eventually they will have plans to attract more funding/strategic
partnerships to extend coverage through the initial US, europe
demonstrations..

Excellent points Henning. +1

We could also add for the WiFi in public: WiFi crowdsharing over any
tech (similar to the FON/PAWS/Freifunk approach).

It will be interesting to see how the DTN solutions (data couriers
through buses/pigeons/donkeys) are really worthwhile: Keshav mentioned
that the reason why their DTN Internet Kiosks in India failed because
they didnt consider the pervasive impact cellular broadband would
have..

However saying that I believe that DTN would be an important tech for
providing flexible Internet services: timeshifting content (in the
presence of a network infrastructure) + opportunistic comms
platforms/apps.

So it will be interesting to see how DTN transitions from R&D into
actual deployments (and eventually successful adoption).

All,

As some of you might have known earlier, we are organising a Dagstuhl
seminar on GAIA
(http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/program/calendar/semhp/?semnr=14471). These
seminars are considered prestigious. It was planned almost two years
ago where our proposal to host this topic went through a rigorous
review process. Unfortunately these seminars are similar to a retreat
where a group are put in a lonely castle in the middle of nowhere and
we discuss and socialise for 3-5 days! I tried to see if I can live
stream and enable remote participation - but this was turned down by
the Dagstuhl organisers.

The list of participants are here:
http://www.dagstuhl.de/program/calendar/partlist/?semnr=14471&SUOG

Our final agenda is here: http://www.dagstuhl.de/schedules/14471.pdf

Interestingly, we are going to spend a good couple of days working on
Jim Forster's proposed GAIA objective:

"to document the costs of existing Internet Access, the breakdown of
those costs (energy, manpower, licenses, bandwidth, infrastructure,
transit, peering), and outline a path to achieve a 10x reduction in
Internet Access costs especially in geographies and populations with
low penetration."

I am hoping we will be documenting the event and we will be able to
share this with GAIA. Slides can be made available too.

Regards
Arjuna

I met Syed Karim, the founder of OuterNet (Lantern), last month in Brazil.
A very nice guy and I was impressed by his drive.  I asked him how OuterNet
had learned from the Worldspace experience.  He answered that a) they use
other people's satellites and b) their ground tech is much cheaper. They
are committed to Open Standards and to re-purposing existing tech like DVB
dishes both of which are big points in their favour IMO.

They will need to develop a large critical mass of users in order to make
the eyeballs driven business model they have work.  They already have a
healthy overhead in making all that data available at satellite teleports.

I think the biggest challenge they face is the fact that, at its heart, the
Internet is a social medium, not a big library.  As Cory Doctorow put it so
well, and I never tire of repeating this because it is forgotten so often,
"Content is not king. Conversation is king. Content is just something to
talk about."   A simple glance at the success of FB tells you this is true.
I think OuterNet is likely to work best in environments where there is
connectivity but it is comparatively expensive.

I do register a little discomfort with any technology that advertises its
utility in disaster-relief without ever having been tested in a real
disaster. OuterNet joins a number of alternative technologies in that
regard.  Perhaps that is simply a catch-22 but it feels slightly
disingenuous.

Cheers... Steve

Thank you Steve

It would be good if GAIA network could increase information flow and help
 connect people with different challenges (the entrepreneurs with possible
innovative solutions and the end users in various regions, for example) if
they decided to partner with local communities worldwide

We could easily run some tests for technologies like Lantern and provide
service usage data when the time is right :-)

We have seen versions of relatively successful "DTN-like" solutions,
including the RedBox (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redbox) DVD video rental
services in many US grocery stores. They are apparently still particularly
popular in more rural areas, with poor broadband availability and quality.

Given the practical limitations of DTNs for real-world applications, I have
my doubts that they can be more than essentially the modern equivalent of
library buses. But library buses still play an important role in rural
areas, so having a bus with essentially all holdings, print or video, of
the country's central library is not a bad thing. (I'm ignoring legal
copyright constraints that, in practice, make it difficult to implement
this, at least today and at least in the US.)

There are essentially three models, it seems:

* demand aggregation: Internet cafes, phone stores, libraries, community
centers, ...

* capital aggregation: in the US, rural electric cooperatives served that
need for rural electrification (and may do the same for some rural
broadband)

All

One of our PhD student in the lab is looking for data for the purposes
of studying effects of human movement and flash crowds on the network
infrastructure (in developed + developing regions). I am wondering if any of
you have or point us to any open data sets please.

On a similar note - I would also like to suggest that if we can get
some interesting network/mobility data from developing regions, it may
be a great idea to share this via the CRAWDAD considering that there
is not much data from the developing regions out there:
http://crawdad.org/map-contributors.html

Probably through GAIA we should try and see if we can collect and
share useful datasets to the rest of the community via CRAWDAD.


The sort of data we are currently looking for are:

A. human mobility data (collected from some sort of digital device):
1- device id,
2- coordinates (good estimates are fine),
3- timestamp per event,
4- consumed services (call, message, web),
5- metadata about service consumed (size, throughput available,
compression, time taken for receipt, etc.),
6- service attempt result (failed or passed),
7- communication pair (if there is direct one-to-one comm. involved),

B. access points data:
1- access point id,
2- coordinates (good estimates are fine, note that these could be same
as above, if so then no need for the above),
3- event subscriber (device id from above, to see who
requested/launched an event),
4- timestamp per event,
5- metadata about event (duration, downlink bytes received for this
request, uplink bytes transferred for this request, compression, time
taken for transfer, etc.),

C. network infrastructure data:
1- network area id (or whatever that identifies a central station for
a group of access points that report to this station),
2- timestamp (could be on a periodic basis - every minute, every 30 minutes),
3- connections (number of connections open at a given time),
4- uplink bytes transferred (sent bytes - serving the request),
5- downlink bytes transferred (received bytes - receiving the request),
6- service metadata (service name - could be multiple of course, or
may be the most popular services for this period),
7- number of devices connected this period,
8- congestion ratio (a number that denotes connected devices against
capacity, or may be consumed capacity vs. free capacity),

D. network installation data: installed capacity (theoretical or
practical downlink capacity, theoretical or practical uplink capacity,
theoretical or practical expected latency),

Thanks

Regards

Hi,

  we used the rich data from the Mobile Data Challenge 
http://research.nokia.com/page/12000. Data was given under special 
agreement but maybe the data are now more publicly available. I didn't 
check.



Cheers
  matthias

The information is quite descriptive, but it seems to be just an 
adaptation of the new high capacity WiFi (802.11ac) to long distances by 
means of an external antenna, nothing really new... they don't even seem 
to know how to tweak the MAC for LD, observing the extremely high 
delays, and they do not provide info about throughput.

Dear Javier,

that was my impression too. Anyway, I found it relevant to be shared 
with the list ...

Despite  the fact that I really like the idea, I am skeptical that this 
can work.
In addition to the problem that Steve pointed out, it is also very 
problematic how they aggregate the data and the selection process behind 
it.
In order to add the content to the downstream you already need to be 
connected. Further more, as it seems to me the suggested data stream 
needs to be in a "public" or better "popular" interest of people that 
are already connected.

It is interesting to look at the current OuterNet feed page (sorte by 
the votes).
I am not sure if the communities that are in the need of ICTs living in 
a remote and undeveloped parts of the world interested in: Hackaday, 
reddit, Zeitgeist, etc.
Or even more problematic ones: Google translate, Google maps, etc...

10 years ago I looked into the one-way satellite internet ( I believe it 
was Astra) downstream. To my surprise 2/3 of the files that I managed to 
capture with a small dish and a dvb-s card was just porn.

    Despite=A0 the fact that I really like the idea, I am skeptical that
    this can work. <br>
    In addition to the problem that Steve pointed out, it is also very
    problematic how they aggregate the data and the selection process
    behind it. <br>
    In order to add the content to the downstream you already need to be
    connected. Further more, as it seems to me the suggested data stream
    needs to be in a "public" or better "popular" interest of people
    that are already connected.<br>
    <br>
    It is interesting to look at the current OuterNet feed page (sorte
    by the votes).<br>
    I am not sure if the communities that are in the need of ICTs living
    in a remote and undeveloped parts of the world interested in:
    Hackaday, reddit, Zeitgeist, etc.<br>
    Or even more problematic ones: Google translate, Google maps, etc...<=
br>
    <br>
    10 years ago I looked into the one-way satellite internet ( I
    believe it was Astra) downstream. To my surprise 2/3 of the files
    that I managed to capture with a small dish and a dvb-s card was
    just porn.<br>

          this is true. I think OuterNet is likely to work best in

        <div>I do register a little discomfort with any technology that
          advertises its utility in disaster-relief without ever having
          been tested in a real disaster. OuterNet joins a number of
          alternative technologies in that regard.=A0 Perhaps that is

Is there a remote participation option? There are some interesting topics,
but it's a day of travel each way.

Hello Arjuna

I helped establish the first TCP/IP link to Kenya back in 1995, and worked 
with folks in Lusaka on the first Internet connection to Zambia as well, 
so I asked some longtime Internet development colleagues about their 
experience thus far with this service.

In Zambia, for example, it is just with one provider (Airtel) and it only 
works if you have an existing data plan.It is reportedly supposed to 
provide a discount on your airtime data package by excluding data to 
certain sites (so just a bill reduction for existing customers). Tech 
users there who tried it said that there was no way to even check to see 
if you were getting that traffic excluded from your data allowance, so 
have found it to be of limited value. For FB access, which is what many 
consumers will want, it's great. But it's not free, wide open Internet 
access and services.

Steve

GAIA -- this is an interesting link -- we could possible sharing your

so yesterday we had Michael Welzl talking about several ways we could
Less than best effort transport/QoS for GAIA

Michael and I have been discussing this for sometime now -

we had this paper on the Performance of LEDBAT in Subpacket regimes
where we were influenced by Jay Chen and Lakshmi's work on TCP
Performance in Subpacket Regimes..in many developing regions we have a
low capacity access network with many users using it simultaneously
and people upload user generated content over these highly
subscribed/multiplexed low capacity access networks..
http://www.intersys-lab.org/media/papers/2014/LEDBAT%20Performance%20in%20Sub-packet%20Regimes.pdf

our paper was a take on "what if" we use LBE transport methods (ledbat
here) for uploading content (pictures & videos). and our final take
was that's not the way to go about --Jay and others have this nice
Eurosys paper on different ways to
solve..https://cs.nyu.edu/~jchen/publications/eurosys14-chen.pdf

Dave Taht emailed us today and thinks we should have tried CoDel and
he has this nice post with some useful comments (if anyone is
interested)..

https://plus.google.com/u/0/107942175615993706558/posts/SHjZwtAXLoX

Would be interesting to see if CoDel could have been a good solution..

Regards

                &gt;=A0 =A0I think this is a good suggestion and we shoul=

                &gt;<br>
                &gt; Also I think we need to add more details on TVWS.
                We will work with Marco and<br>
                &gt; Ermanno on this.<br>

                &gt; &gt; Is there a particular reason that only
                802.11af is mentioned when it<br>
                &gt; &gt; comes to TVWS?=A0 Would it not make sense to

                &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; p.5 The Free Network description does
                not read well here, since it<br>
                &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; MAY be the same as a Community
                Network. I suggest to create a<br>
                &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; separate sub-section, where we define
                a Free Network.<br>

                networks or free networks. We<br>
                &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; should make it clear.<br>
                &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; p.6 =93These networks are also called

                This is a repetition, since it<br>
                &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; is already mentioned in the previous
                paragraph.<br>
                &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; p.6-7 The way crowdshared approaches
                and user-centric approaches<br>
                &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; are defined right now is a little
                confusing, since they look really<br>
                &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; similar. We can add some examples of
                each case to highlight the<br>
                &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; differences.<br>

                actors in user-centric networks<br>
                &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; start abruptly. We should first add a

                &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; involved in a user-centric network

                &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; p.8 We should define ISP and ASP
                acronyms when we first use them.<br>
                &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; p.8 We should rename Section 2.4
                Testbeds to Testbeds for research<br>
                &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; purposes to make it more clear.<br>
                &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; p.8 Section 3.1 mostly describes
                developing countries and digital<br>
                &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; divide, not network deployment
                scenarios. For this reason, we could<br>
                &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; rename this section =93Digital Divide=94=

Hi Arjuna,

Zero-rating per se is not a net-neutrality violation according to the
definition provided:

 "Internet users are entitled to an Internet connection that is free of
discrimination with regard to type of application, service or content or
based on sender or receiver address."

If organisations are permitted to zero-rate a service on a level-playing
field, that is to say anyone can pay to zero-rate a service without fear or
favour, then this is no more a net neutrality violation than a CDN is.
Similarly, if Facebook invests millions of dollars in optimising its mobile
application so that it consumes 50% of the bandwidth of similar
applications, is that a violation of net neutrality?  Few would claim so
yet the net effect is the same as zero-rating.

The problem with zero-rating is that it is often not being carried out in
either a fair or transparent manner.   I would not be very surprised if
many of the zero-rating deals being made by operators are exclusive ones
which preclude competitors to WhatsApp, Spotify, or whoever has made the
zero-rating deal from purchasing a similar deal.

Regards... Steve

we have been discussing at the Dagstuhl about how ads wastes up
capacity and whether we could get ad providers to pay for usage etc..

this is interesting and relevant to those discussions:

One thing that crossed my mind -

It will be great if we encourage and engage young and upcoming
researchers in developing regions and involve them in work related to
GAIA and publishing the work that comes out of such collaborations
with them. I think if we can foster such peer support and provide
opportunities - this will be beneficial and stimulate a better
research and publication culture and will also open new opportunities
for researchers in developing regions..

also call for ISOC fellowships to the IETF below..

Dear Colleagues,


The Internet Society has announced that it is inviting applications
for its latest Internet Society Fellowships to the IETF.  The
Fellowship programme allows engineers from emerging and developing
economies to attend an Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) meeting.

As you know, the IETF is the Internet's premier standards-making body,
responsible for the development of protocols used in IP-based
networks. IETF participants represent an international community of
network designers, operators, vendors, and researchers involved in the
technical operation of the Internet and the continuing evolution of
Internet architecture.

Fellowships will be awarded through a competitive application process.
The Internet Society is currently accepting fellowship applications
for the IETF 92 in Dallas, Texas:

* IETF 92, March 22-27, 2015, Dallas, Texas, United States.

Information and links to apply can be found at:
http://www.internetsociety.org/fellows-ietf

Fellowship applications will now close on 7 December, 2014.

I encourage you apply or pass this information about this program to
individuals involved in your network that have a keen interest in the
Internet protocol development activities of the IETF.

The Internet Society Fellowships to the IETF are sponsored by Afilias,
Google, NBCUniversal, Microsoft, and Verisign.

If you have questions, please do not hesitate to contact Niel Harper
<harper@isoc.org>.

Regards,

Hi all,
=20
This week I will use the feedback received in order to write a new =
version of the =E2=80=9CAlternative Network Deployments=E2=80=9D Draft.
=20
The idea of this draft is to set a clear "classification" or a =
"taxonomy" of Alternative Network Deployments.
=20
We have three possible approaches:
=20
(1) To write a draft including everything, i.e. the classification =
itself and very long explaining about each kind of network. This would =
be a =E2=80=9Cfat=E2=80=9D document including everything. The drawback =
of this approach: Consensus will be very difficult to reach, because we =
can get blocked in many parts.
=20
=20
(2) To split the draft into a number of different documents (with =
different authors), each one about one kind of Alternative Network. The =
classification could be something like:
- Community Networks
- Crowdshared approaches, led by the people and third party stakeholders
- User-centric Networks=20
- Testbed
=20
Drawback: If we just split the current draft into a number of documents, =
we may lose the classification.
=20
=20
(3) A thin "classification" draft and some other "fat" ones explaining =
each kind of Alternative Networks. Perhaps we could keep the initial =
draft "thin" enough so as to permit other ones further exploring and =
explaining each kind of network in deep.
=20
=20
Currently, the authors of the draft think that the most practical =
approach could be (3): let's start with a classification, and see if we =
can find people for writing the other ones. Following this approach, the =
strength of the =E2=80=9CAlternative Network Deployments=E2=80=9D =
document will be the classification, not a very deep explaining about =
each kind of network.

Ermanno, thanks a lot for the feedback!.
=20
If everyone agrees, we can discuss the "Alternative Network Deployments" =
draft in the list for two more weeks, and then we could try to write a =
new version of the draft during the week 24th-28th November.

Thanks Ermanno,
Should we also write more on TVWS - about geolocation databases and why =
using proprietary databases may not be the right way forward to connect =
rural areas in developing regions - and whether cognitive sensing could =
be used because there is enough spectrum along with the spectrum masking =
details etc?.
Or do you think it will be too much for this document..

    Alternative Network Deployments.  Taxonomy and characterization
               draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01
=20
Abstract
=20
   This document presents a taxonomy of "alternative network
   deployments", and a set of definitions and shared characteristics.
   This term includes a set of network models emerged in the last
   decades with the aim of bringing Internet connectivity to people,
   following topological, architectural and business models different
   from the so-called "traditional" ones, where a company deploys the
   infrastructure connecting the households of the users, who pay for
   it.
=20
   Several initiatives throughout the World have built large scale
   networks that use wireless technologies (including long distance) due
   to the reduced cost of using the unlicensed spectrum.  Others rely on
   wired technologies.  Some of these networks are self-organized and
   decentralized, other ones are based on sharing wireless resources of
   the users.  The emergence of these networks can be motivated by
   different causes: Sometimes the reluctance, or the impossibility, of
   network operators to provide wired and cellular infrastructures to
   rural/remote areas.  In these cases, the networks have self
   sustainable business models that provide more localised communication
   services as well as providing Internet backhaul support through
   peering agreements with traditional network operators.  Some other
   times, they are built as a complement and an alternative to
   commercial Internet access provided by "traditional" network
   operators.

   The classification considers different existing network models as
   e.g., community networks, open wireless services, user-extensible
   services, traditional local ISPs, new global ISPs, etc.  Different
   criteria are used in order to build a classification as e.g., the
   ownership of the equipment, the way the network is organized, the
   participatory model, the extensibility, if they are driven by a
   community, a company or a local (public or private) stakeholder, etc.
=20
   According to the developed taxonomy, a characterization of each kind
   of network is presented, in terms of network characteristics related
   to architecture, organization, etc.

   networks that use wireless technologies (including long distance) due
   to the reduced cost of using the unlicensed spectrum.  Others rely on

   wired technologies.  Some of them are self-organized and
   decentralized, other ones are based on sharing wireless resources of
   the users.  The emergence of these networks can be motivated by
   different causes: Sometimes the reluctance, or the impossibility, of
   network operators to provide wired and cellular infrastructures to
   rural/remote areas [ =
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#re=
f-Pietrosemoli> Pietrosemoli].  In these cases, the networks have
   self sustainable business models that provide more localised
   communication services as well as providing Internet backhaul support
   through peering agreements with traditional network operators.  Some
   other times, they are built as a complement and an alternative to
   commercial Internet access provided by "traditional" network
   operators.
=20
   One of the aims of the Global Access to the Internet for All (GAIA)
   IRTF initiative is "to document and share deployment experiences and
   research results to the wider community through scholarly
   publications, white papers, Informational and Experimental RFCs,
   etc."  In line with this objective this document is intended to
   propose a classification of these "alternative network deployments".
   This term includes a set of network models emerged in the last
   decades with the aim of bringing Internet connectivity to people,
   following topological, architectural and business models different
   from the so-called "traditional" ones, where a company deploys the
   infrastructure connecting the households of the users, who pay for
   it.  The document is intended to be largely descriptive providing a
   broad overview of initiatives, technologies and approaches employed
   in these networks.  Research references describing each kind of
   network are also provided.

=20
   This section classifies Alternative Networks according to their
   intended usage.  Each of them have different incentive structures,
   maybe common technological challenges, but most importantly
   interesting usage challenges which feeds into the incentives as well
   as technological challenges.
=20
   This classification is agnostic from the technical point of view.
   Technology in this case must be taken as implementation.  Moreover,
   many of these networks are implemented in a way that several
   technologies (Ad-Hoc WiFi, Infrastructure WiFi, Optical Fibre, IPv4,
   IPv6, RFC1918 <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918> , OLSR, BMX6, =
etc.) coexist.

ction-2.1> 2.1.  Community Networks
=20
   Community Networks are large-scale, distributed, self-managed
   networks sharing these characteristics:
=20
   - They are built and organized in a decentralized and open manner.
=20
   - They start and grow organically, they are open to participation
   from everyone, sometimes agreeing to an open peering agreement.
   Community members are directly contributing active network
   infrastructure (not just passive infrastructure).
=20
   - Knowledge about building and maintaining the network and ownership
   of the network itself is decentralized and open.  Community members
   have an obvious and direct form of organizational control over the
   overall operation of the network in their community (not just their
   own participation in the network).
=20
   - The network CAN serve as a backhaul for providing a whole range of
   services and applications, from completely free to even commercial
   services.
=20
   Hardware and software used in community networks CAN be very diverse,
   even inside one network.  A Community Network CAN have both wired and
   wireless links.  The network CAN be managed by multiple routing
   protocols or network topology management systems.
=20
   A definition of Free Network (which MAY be the same as Community
   Network) is proposed by the Free Network Foundation (see
    <http://thefnf.org/> http://thefnf.org) as:
=20
   A free network equitably grants the following freedoms to all:
=20
   Freedom 0 - Freedom to communicate for any purpose, without
   discrimination, interference, or interception.
=20
   Freedom 1 - The freedom to grow, improve, communicate across, and
   connect to the whole network.
=20
   Freedom 2- The freedom to study, use, remix, and share any network
   communication mechanisms, in their most reusable forms."
=20
   The principles of these networks have also been summarized (see
    <http://guifi.net/ca/CXOLN> http://guifi.net/ca/CXOLN) this way:
=20
   - You have the freedom to use the network for any purpose as long as
   you don't harm the operation of the network itself , the rights of

=20
   other users, or the principles of neutrality that allow contents and
   services to flow without deliberate interference.
=20
   - You have the right to understand the network, to know its
   components, and to spread knowledge of its mechanisms and principles.
=20
   - You have the right to offer services and content to the network on
   your own terms.
=20
   - You have the right to join the network, and the responsibility to
   extend this set of rights to anyone according to these same terms.
=20
   These networks grow organically, since they are formed by the
   aggregation of nodes belonging to different users.  A minimum
   governance infrastructure is required in order to coordinate IP
   addressing, routing, etc.  A clear example of this kind of Community
   Network is described in [ =
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#re=
f-Braem> Braem].  These networks are effective in
   enhancing and extending digital Internet rights following a
   participatory model.
=20
   The fact of the users adding new infrastructure can be used to build
   another definition: A network in which any participant in the system
   may add link segments to the network in such a way that the new
   network segments can support multiple nodes and adopt the same
   overall characteristics as those of the joined network, including the
   capacity to further extend the network.  Once these link segments are
   joined to the network, there is no longer a meaningful distinction
   between the previous extent of the network and the new extent of the
   network.  In that sense, Community Networks can be called "user-
   extensible networks".
=20
   These networks are also called sometimes "Free Networks" or even
   "Network Commons".  However, the most accepted name is Community
   Networks.
=20
   In Community Networks, the profit can only be made by services and
   not by the infrastructure itself, because the infrastructure is
   neutral, free, and open (traditional ISPs base their business on the
   control of the infrastructure).  In Community Networks, everybody
   keeps the ownership of what he/she has contributed.

party
      stakeholders
=20
   These networks follow the following approach: the home router creates =
two
   wireless networks, one of them to be normally used by the owner, and
   the other one is public.  A small fraction of the bandwidth is
   allocated to the public network (as e.g.  Less-than-best-effort or

   scavenger traffic), to be employed by any user of the service in the
   immediate area.  An example is described in [ =
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#re=
f-PAWS> PAWS].
=20
   A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is created for public traffic, so it
   is completely secure and separated from the owner's connection.  The
   network capacity shared may employ a less-than-best-effort approach,
   so as not to harm the traffic of the owner of the connection
   [ =
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#re=
f-Sathiaseelan_a> Sathiaseelan_a].
=20
   There are three actors in the scenario:
=20
   - End users who sign up for the service and share their network
   capacity.  As a counterpart, they can access anyone's home broadband
   for free.
=20
   - Virtual Network Operators (VNOs) are stakeholders with socio-
   environmental objectives.  They can be a local government, grass root
   user communities, charities, or even content operators, smart grid
   operators, etc.  They are the ones who actually run the service.
=20
   - Network operators, who have a financial incentive to lease out the
   unused capacity [ =
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#re=
f-Sathiaseelan_b> Sathiaseelan_b] at lower cost to the VNOs.
=20
   VNOs pay the sharers and the network operators, thus creating an
   incentive structure for all the actors: the end users get money for
   sharing their network, the network operators are paid by the VNOs,
   who in turn accomplish their socio-environmental role.

=20
   A first example is constituted by the networks created and managed by =
City Councils
   (e.g., [ =
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#re=
f-Heer> Heer]).  Some companies [FON reference missing] develop and
   sell Wi-Fi routers with a dual access: a Wi-Fi network for the user,
   and a shared one.  A user community is created, an people can join it
   different ways: they can buy a dual router, so they share their
   connection and in turn they get access to all the routers associated
   to the community.  Some users can even get some revenues every time
   another user connects to their Wi-Fi spot.  Other users can just buy
   some passes in order to use the network.  Some telecommunications
   operators can collaborate with the community, including in their
   routers the possibility of creating these two networks.
=20
   These networks can be defined as a set of nodes whose owners share
   common interests (e.g. sharing connectivity; resources; peripherals)
   regardless of their physical location.  The node location exhibits a
   space and time correlation which is the basis to establish a robust
   connectivity model over time.

   - "Interest": a parameter capable of providing a measure (cost) of
   the attractiveness of a node towards a specific location, in a
   specific instant in time.
=20
   - The owner: an entity (e.g. end-user; operator; virtual operator;
   municipality) that is to be made responsible for any actions
   concerning his/her device.
=20
   - The user: a legal entity or an individual using or requesting a
   publicly available electronic communications' service for private or
   business purposes, without necessarily having subscribed to such
   service.
=20
   - Resources: A physical or virtual element of a global system.  For
   instance, bandwdith; energy; data; devices.
=20
   - The Virtual Operator: entity that acts in some aspects as a network
   coordinator.  It may provide services such as initial authentication
   or registering, and eventually, trust relationship storage.  A VO is
   not an ISP given that it does not provide Internet access (e.g.
   infrastructure; naming).  A VO is neither an ASP since it does not
   provide user services.

   Alternative Network Deployments are present in every part of the

   network operators.  This section discusses the scenarios where
   alternative networks are interesting or have been deployed.

   There is no definition for what a developing country represents that
   has been recognized internationally, but the term is generally used
   to describe a nation with a low level of material well-being.  In
   this sense, one of the most commonly used classification is the one
   by the World Bank, who ranks countries according to their Gross
   National Income (GNI) per Capita: low income, middle income, and high
   income, being those falling within the low and middle income groups
   considered developing economies.  Developing countries have been also
   defined as those which are in transition from traditional lifestyles

   towards the modern lifestyle which began in the Industrial
   Revolution.  Additionally, the Human Development Index, which
   considers not only the GNI but also life expectancy and education,
   has been proposed by the United Nations to rank countries according
   to the well-being of a country and not solely based on economic
   terms.  These classifications are used to give strong signals to the
   international community to the need of special concessions in support
   of these countries, implying a correlation between development and
   increased well-being.
=20
   However, at the beginning of the 90's the debates about how to
   quantify development in a country were shaken by the appearance of
   Internet and mobile phones, which many authors consider the beginning
   of the Information Society.  With the beginning of this Digital
   Revolution, defining development based on Industrial Society concepts
   started to be challenged, and links between digital development and
   its impact on human development started to flourish.  The following
   dimensions are considered to be meaningful when measuring the digital
   development state of a country: infrastructures (availability and
   affordability); ICT sector (human capital and technological
   industry); digital literacy; legal and regulatory framework; and
   content and services.  The lack or less extent of digital development
   in one or more of these dimensions is what has been referred as
   Digital Divide.  This divide is a new vector of inequality which - as
   it happened during the Industrial Revolution - generates a lot of
   progress at the expense of creating a lot economic poverty and
   exclusion.  The Digital Divide is considered to be a consequence of
   other socio-economic divides, while, at the same time, a reason for
   their rise.
=20
   In this context, the so-called "developing countries", worried of
   being left behind of this incipient digital revolution, motivated the
   World Summit of the Information Society which aimed at achieving "a
   people-centred, inclusive and development-oriented Information
   Society, where everyone can create, access, utilize and share
   information and knowledge, enabling individuals, communities and
   peoples to achieve their full potential in promoting their
   sustainable development and improving their quality of life" [ =

   problem, some governments included Universal Service and Access
   obligations to mobile network operators when liberalizing the
   telecommunications market.  In combination with the overwhelming and
   unexpected uptake of mobile phones by poor people, this has mitigated
   the low access indicators existing in many developing countries at
   the beginning of the 90s [ =

f-Rendon> Rendon].
=20
   Although it is undeniable the contribution made by mobile network
   operators in decreasing the access gap, their model presents some
   constraints that limits the development outcomes that increased
   connectivity promises to bring.  Prices, tailored for the more
   affluent part of the population, remain unaffordable to many, who
   invest large percentages of their disposable income in
   communications.  Additionally, the cost of prepaid packages, the only
   option available for the informal economies existing throughout
   developing countries, is high compared with the rate longer-term
   subscribers pay.
=20
   The consolidation of many Alternative Networks (e.g.  Community
   Networks) in high income countries sets a precedent for civil society
   members from the so-called developing countries to become more active
   in the search for alternatives to provide themselves with affordable
   access.  Furthermore, Alternative Networks could contribute to other
   dimensions of the digital development like increased human capital
   and the creation of contents and services targeting the locality of
   each network.

=20
   The Digital Divide presented in the previous section is not only
   present between countries, but within them too.  This is specially
   the case for rural inhabitants, which represents approximately 55% of
   the World's population, from which 78% inhabit in developing
   countries.  Although it is impossible to generalize among them, there
   exist some common features that have determined the availability of
   ICT infrastructure in these regions.  The disposable income of their
   dwellers is lower than those inhabiting urban areas, with many
   surviving on a subsistence economy.  Many of them are located in
   geographies difficult to access and exposed to extreme weather
   conditions.  This has resulted in the almost complete lack of
   electrical infrastructure.  This context, together with their low
   population density, discourages telecommunications operators to
   provide similar services to those provided to urban dwellers, since
   they do not deem them profitable
=20
   The cost of the wireless infrastructure required to set up a network,
   including powering them via solar energy, is within the range of
   availability if not of individuals at least of entire communities.

   The social capital existing in these areas can allow for Alternative
   Network set-ups where a reduced number of nodes may cover communities
   whose dwellers share the cost of the infrastructure and the gateway
   and access it via inexpensive wireless devices.  In this case, the
   lack of awareness and confidence of rural communities to embark
   themselves in such tasks can become major barriers to their
   deployment.  Scarce technical skills in these regions have been also
   pointed as a challenge for their success, but the proliferation of
   urban Community Networks, where scarcity of spectrum, scale, and
   heterogeneity of devices pose tremendous challenges to their
   stability and to that of the services they aim to provide, has
   fuelled the creation of robust low-cost low-consumption low-
   complexity off-the-self wireless devices which make much easier the
   deployment and maintenance of these alternative infrastructures in
   rural areas.

=20
   Three kinds of antennas are suitable to be used in these networks:
   omnidirectional, directional and high gain antennas.
=20
   For local access, omnidirectional antennas are the most useful, since
   they provide the same coverage in all directions of the plane in
   which they are located.  Above and below this plane, the received
   signal will diminish, so the maximum benefits are obtained when the
   client is at approximately the same height as the Access Point.

Internet-Draft       Alternative Network Deployments        October 2014
=20
=20
   When using an omnidirectional antenna outdoors to provide
   connectivity to a large area, people often select high gain antennas
   located at the highest structure available to extend the coverage.
   In many cases this is counterproductive, since a high gain
   omnidirectional antenna will have a very narrow beamwidth in the
   vertical plane, meaning that clients that are below the plane of the
   antenna will receive a very weak signal (and by the reciprocity
   property of all antennas, the omni will also receive a feeble signal
   from the client).  So a moderate gain omnidirectional of about 8 to
   10 dBi is normally preferable.  Higher gain omnis antennas are only
   advisable when the farthest way client are roughly in the same plane.
=20
   For indoor clients, omnis are generally fine, because the numerous
   reflections normally found in indoor environments negate the
   advantage of using directive antennas.
=20
   For outdoor clients, directive antennas can be quite useful to extend
   coverage to an Access Point fitted with an omni.
=20
   When building point to point links, the highest gain antennas are the
   best choice, since their narrow beamwidth mitigates interference from
   other users and can provide the longest links [ =

f-Flickenger> Flickenger] [ =
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#re=
f-Zennaro> Zennaro].
=20
   24 to 34 dBi antennas are commercially available at both the
   unlicensed 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands, and even higher gain antennas can
   be found in the newer unlicensed bands at 17 GHz and 24 GHz.
=20
   Despite the fact that the free space loss is directly proportional to
   the square of the frequency, it is normally advisable to use higher
   frequencies for point to point links when there is a clear line of
   sight, because it is normally easier to get higher gain antennas at
   5 GHz.  Deploying high gain antennas at both ends will more than
   compensate for the additional free space loss.  Furthermore, higher
   frequencies can make do with lower altitude antenna placement since
   the Fresnel zone is inversely proportional to the square root of the
   frequency.
=20
   On the contrary, lower frequencies offer advantages when the line of
   sight is blocked because they can leverage diffraction to reach the
   intended receiver.
=20
   It is common to find dual radio Access Points, at two different
   frequency bands.  One way of benefiting from this arrangement is to
   attach a directional antenna to the high frequency radio for
   connection to the backbone and an omni to the lower frequency to
   provide local access.

=20
=20
   Of course, in the case of mesh networking, where the antenna should
   connect to several other nodes, it is better to use omnidirectional
   antennas.
=20
   Keep also in mind that the same type of polarisation must be used at
   both ends of any radio link.  For point to point links, some vendor
   use two radios operating at the same frequency but with orthogonal
   polarisations, thus doubling the achievable throughput, and also
   offering added protection to multipath and other transmission
   impairments.

ction-4.2.2> 4.2.2.  Link length
=20
   For short distance transmission, there is no strict requirement of
   line of sight between the transmitter and the receiver, and multipath
   can guarantee communication despite the existence of obstacles in the
   direct path.
=20
   For longer distances, the first requirement is the existence of an
   unobstructed line of sight between the transmitter and the receiver.
   For very long path the earth curvature is an obstacle that must be
   cleared, but the trajectory of the radio beam is not strictly a
   straight line due to the bending of the rays as a consequence of non-
   uniformities of the atmosphere.  Most of the time this bending will
   mean that the radio horizon extends further than the optical horizon.
=20
   Another factor to be considered is that radio waves occupy a volume
   around the optical line, which must be unencumbered from obstacles
   for the maximum signal to be captured at the receiver.  This volume
   is known as the Fresnel ellipsoid and its size grows with the
   distance between the end points and with the wavelength of the
   signal, which in turn is inversely proportional to the frequency.
=20
   So, for optimum signal reception the end points must be high enough
   to clear any obstacle in the path and leave extra "elbow room" for
   the Fresnel zone.  This can be achieved by using suitable masts at
   either end, or by taking advantage of existing structures or hills.
=20
   Once a clear radio-electric line of sight (including the Fresnel zone
   clearance) is obtained, one must ascertain that the received power is
   well above the sensitivity of the receiver, by what is known as the
   link margin.  The greater the link margin, the more reliable the
   link.  For mission critical applications 20 dB margin is suggested,
   but for non critical ones 10 dB might suffice.
=20
   Bear in mind that the sensitivity of the receiver decreases with the
   transmission speed, so more power is needed at greater transmission
   speeds.

ge-14> =20
Internet-Draft       Alternative Network Deployments        October 2014
=20
=20
   The received power is determined by the transmitted power, the gain
   of the transmitting and receiving antennas and the propagation loss.
=20
   The propagation loss is the sum of the free space loss (proportional
   to the square of the the frequency and the square of the distance),
   plus additional factors like attenuation in the atmosphere by gases
   or meteorological effects (which are strongly frequency dependent),
   multipath and diffraction losses.
=20
   Multipath is more pronounced in trajectories over water, if they
   cannot be avoided special countermeasures should be taken.
=20
   So to achieve a given link margin (also called fade margin), one can:
=20
   a) increase the output power. The maximum transmitted power is
   specified by the country's regulation, and for unlicensed frequencies
   is much lower than for licensed frequencies.
=20
   b) Increase the antenna gain.  There is no limit in the gain of the
   receiving antenna, but high gain antennas are bulkier, present more
   wind resistance and require sturdy mounts to comply with tighter
   alignment requirements.  The transmitter antenna gain is also
   regulated and can be different for point to point as for point to
   multipoint links.  Many countries impose a limit in the combination
   of transmitted power and antenna gain, the EIRP (Equivalent
   Isotropically Irradiated Power) which can be different for point to
   point or point to multipoint links.
=20
   c) Reduce the propagation loss, by using a more favourable frequency
   or a shorter path.
=20
   d) Use a more sensitive receiver.  Receiver sensitivity can be
   improved by using better circuits, but it is ultimately limited by
   the thermal noise, which is proportional to temperature and
   bandwidth.  So one can increase the sensitivity by using a smaller
   receiving bandwidth, or by settling to lower throughput even in the
   same receiver bandwidth.  This step is often done automatically in
   many protocols, in which the transmission speed can be reduced say
   from 150 Mbit/s to 6 Mbit/s if the receiver power is not enough to
   sustain the maximum throughput.
=20
   A completely different limiting factor is related with the medium
   access protocol.  WiFi was designed for short distance, and the
   transmitter expects the reception of an acknowledgment for each
   transmitted packet in a certain amount of time, if the waiting time
   is exceeded, the packet is retransmitted.  This will reduce
   significantly the throughput at long distance, so for long distance
   application it is better to use a different medium access technique,

   in which the receiver does not wait for an acknowledgement of the
   transited packet.  This strategy of TDMA (Time Domain Multiple
   Access) has been adopted by many equipment vendors who offer
   proprietary protocols alongside the standard WiFi in order to
   increase the throughput at longer distances.  Low cost equipment
   using TDMA can offer high throughput at distances over 100
   kilometres.

networks
=20
   Before packets can be forwarded and routed to the Internet, layers
   one (the physical) and two (the data link) need to be connected.
   Without link local connectivity, network nodes cannot talk to each
   other and route packets.
=20
   To provide physical connectivity, wireless network devices must
   operate in the same part of the radio spectrum.  This means that
   802.11a radios will talk to 802.11a radios at around 5 GHz, and
   802.11b/g radios will talk to other 802.11b/g radios at around 2.4
   GHz.  But an 802.11a device cannot interoperate with an 802.11b/g
   device, since they use completely different parts of the
   electromagnetic spectrum.  More specifically, wireless interfaces
   must agree on a common channel.  If one 802.11b radio card is set to
   channel 2 while another is set to channel 11, then the radios cannot
   communicate with each other.
=20
   When two wireless interfaces are configured to use the same protocol
   on the same radio channel, then they are ready to negotiate data link
   layer connectivity.  Each 802.11a/b/g device can operate in one of
   four possible modes:
=20
   1.Master mode (also called AP or infrastructure mode) is used to
   create a service that looks like a traditional access point.  The
   wireless interface creates a network with a specified name (called
   the SSID) and channel, and offers network services on it.  While in
   master mode, wireless interfaces manage all communications related to
   the network (authenticating wireless clients, handling channel
   contention, repeating packets, etc.)  Wireless interfaces in master
   mode can only communicate with interfaces that are associated with
   them in managed mode.
=20
   2.Managed mode is sometimes also referred to as client mode.
   Wireless interfaces in managed mode will join a network created by a
   master, and will automatically change their channel to match it.
   They then present any necessary credentials to the master, and if
   those credentials are accepted, they are said to be associated with
   the master.  Managed mode interfaces do not communicate with each

   3.Ad-hoc mode creates a multipoint-to-multipoint network where there
   is no single master node or AP.  In ad-hoc mode, each wireless
   interface communicates directly with its neighbours.  Nodes must be
   in range of each other to communicate, and must agree on a network
   name and channel.  Ad-hoc mode is often also called Mesh Networking.

   4.Monitor mode is used by some tools (such as Kismet) to passively
   listen to all radio traffic on a given channel.  When in monitor =
mode,
   wireless interfaces transmit no data.  This is useful for analysing
   problems on a wireless link or observing spectrum usage in the local
   area.  Monitor mode is not used for normal communications.
=20
   When implementing a point-to-point or point-to-multipoint link, one
   radio will typically operate in master mode, while the other(s)
   operate in managed mode.  In a multipoint-to-multipoint mesh, the
   radios all operate in ad-hoc mode so that they can communicate with
   each other directly.  Remember that managed mode clients cannot
   communicate with each other directly, so it is likely that you will
   want to run a high repeater site in master or ad-hoc mode.  Ad-hoc is
   more flexible but has a number of performance issues as compared to
   using the master / managed modes.

   Most known Alternative Networks started in or around the year 2000.
   IPv6 was fully specified by then, but almost all Alternative
   Networks still use IPv4.  A community networks survey [ =
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#re=

   indicated that IPv6 rollout presents a challenge to Community =
Networks.

   by  <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918> RFC 1918 [ =

ction-5.1.2> 5.1.2.  Routing protocols
=20
   These networks are composed of possibly different layer 2 devices,
   resulting in a mesh of nodes.  Connection between different nodes is
   not guaranteed, the link stability can vary strongly over time.  To
   tackle this, some Community Networks use mesh network routing
   protocols while other networks use more traditional routing
   protocols.  Some networks operate multiple routing protocols in
   parallel.  E.g., they use a mesh protocol inside different islands
   and use traditional routing protocols to connect islands.

   The BGP protocol, as defined by  <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4271> =
RFC 4271 [ <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4271> RFC4271] is used by a
   number of Community Networks, because of its well-studied behavior
   and scalability.
=20
   For similar reasons, smaller Community Networks opt to run the OSPF
   protocol, as defined by  <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2328> RFC =
2328 [ <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2328> RFC2328].

   defined in  <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3626> RFC 3626 [ =
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3626> RFC3626].  The pro-active link =

=20
   From crowd shared perspective, and considering just regular TCP
   connections during the critical sharing time, the Access Point
   offering the service is likely to be the bottleneck of the
   connection.  This is the main concern of sharers, having several
   implications.  There should be an adequate Active Queue Management
   (AQM) mechanism that implements a Less than Best Effort policy for =
the
   user and protect the sharer.  Achieving LBE behaviour requires the
   appropriate tuning of the well known mechanisms such as ECN, or RED,
   or others more recent AQM mechanisms such as CoDel and PIE that aid
   on keeping low latency  <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6297> RFC 6297 =

   The user traffic should not interfere with the sharers traffic.
   However, other bottlenecks besides client's access bottleneck may not
   be controlled by the previously mentioned protocols.  Therefore, =
recently
   proposed transport protocols like LETBAT [reference required] with
   the purpose of transporting scavenger traffic may be a solution.
   LEDBAT requires the cooperation of both the client and the server to
   achieve certain target delay, therefore controlling the impact of the
   user along all the path.
=20
   There are applications that manage aspects of the network from the
   sharer side and from the client side.  From sharer's side, there are
   applications to centralise the management of the APs conforming the
   network that have been recently proposed by means of SDN

   Wi2Me [ =
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#re=

Community
   Networks from the client's side.  This application have shown to
   improve the client performance compared to a single-Community Network
   client.
=20
   On the other hand, transport protocols inside a multiple hop wireless
   mesh network are likely to suffer performance degradation for
   multiple reasons, e.g., hidden terminal problem, unnecessary delays
   on the TCP ACK clocking that decrease the throughout or route
   changing [ =
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#re=
f-Hanbali> Hanbali].  So, there are some options for network
   configuration.  The implementation of an easy-to-adopt solution for
   TCP over mesh networks may be implemented from two different
   perspectives.  One way is to use a TCP-proxy to transparently deal
   with the different impairments  <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3135> =
RFC 3135 [ <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3135> RFC3135].  Another way =
is to
   adopt end-to-end solutions for monitoring the connection delay so
   that the receiver adapts the TCP reception window (rwnd)
   [ =
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-manyfolks-gaia-community-networks-01#re=
f-Castignani_c> Castignani_c].  Similarly, the ACK Congestion Control =
(ACKCC)
   mechanism  <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5690> RFC 5690 [ =
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5690> RFC5690] could deal with TCP-ACK =
clocking
   impairments due to inappropriate delay on ACK packets.  ACKCC
   compensates in an end-to-end fashion the throughput degradation due
   to the effect of media contention as well as the unfairness
   experienced by multiple uplink TCP flows in a congested WiFi access.

=20
   Regularly rural areas in these networks are connected through long-
   distance links (the so-called community mesh approach) which in turn
   convey the Internet connection to relevant organisations or
   institutions.  In contrast, in urban areas, users tend to share and
   require mobile access.  Since these areas are also likely to be
   covered by commercial ISPs, the provision of wireless access by
   Virtual Operators like FON is the way to extend the user capacity (or
   gain connection) to the network.  Other proposals like Virtual Public
   Networks [ =

   As in the case of main Internet Service Providers in France,
   Community Networks for urban areas are conceived as a set of APs
   sharing a common SSID among the clients favouring the nomadic access.
   For users in France, ISPs promise to cause a little impact on their
   service agreement when the shared network service is activated on
   clients' APs.  Nowadays, millions of APs are deployed around the
   country performing services of nomadism and 3G offloading, however as
   some studies demonstrate, at walking speed, there is a fair chance
   of performing file transfers [ =

Hello Jose

IMHO, option (1) would lack of flexibility, and option (2) could easily 
drive to some overlapping  and lack of consistency. So I guess that I 
vote (3). It sounds good starting with an initial "thin" draft, and try 
to keep the development of each subsection balanced in style, extension 
and type of content.

In the current version, I guess that my contributions can be in 
"testbed", and specifically in rural communications using wireless 
technologies. However, I think that the classification may be improved 
trying to present a 'multidimensional model' in the introduction in 
which the variables used for the taxonomy are more clearly stated 
(incentive, promoter, technology, population, ... ?) and used 
consistently all along the document. If there is interest to cook a bit 
more the classification in this sense, we can try to do it in this step 
by proposing two -or more- alternate drafts: one strictly based in what 
exists now, and may be another more ellaborated. Let me know if you 
think that this makes sense.

> Community Networks are large-scale, distributed, self-managed

>
> - They are built and organized in a decentralized and open manner.
>
> - They start and grow organically, they are open to participation
>
> from everyone, sometimes agreeing to an open peering agreement.
>
> Community members are directly contributing active network
>
> infrastructure (not just passive infrastructure).
>
> - Knowledge about building and maintaining the network and ownership
>
> of the network itself is decentralized and open. Community members
>
> have an obvious and direct form of organizational control over the
>
> overall operation of the network in their community (not just their
>
> own participation in the network).
>
> - The network CAN serve as a backhaul for providing a whole range of
>
> services and applications, from completely free to even commercial
>
> services.
>
> Hardware and software used in community networks CAN be very diverse,
>
> even inside one network.  A Community Network CAN have both wired and
>
> wireless links.  The network CAN be managed by multiple routing
>
> protocols or network topology management systems.
>
> A definition of Free Network (which MAY be the same as Community
>
> Network) is proposed by the Free Network Foundation (see
>
> http://thefnf.org <http://thefnf.org/>) as:
>
> A free network equitably grants the following freedoms to all:
>
> Freedom 0 - Freedom to communicate for any purpose, without
>
> discrimination, interference, or interception.
>
> Freedom 1 - The freedom to grow, improve, communicate across, and
>
> connect to the whole network.
>
> Freedom 2- The freedom to study, use, remix, and share any network
>
> communication mechanisms, in their most reusable forms."
>
> The principles of these networks have also been summarized (see

    Hello Jose<br>
    <br>
    IMHO, option (1) would lack of flexibility, and option (2) could
    easily drive to some overlapping and lack of consistency. So I
    guess that I vote (3). It sounds good starting with an initial
    "thin" draft, and try to keep the development of each subsection
    balanced in style, extension and type of content.<br>
    <br>
    In the current version, I guess that my contributions can be in
    "testbed", and specifically in rural communications using wireless
    technologies. However, I think that the classification may be
    improved trying to present a 'multidimensional model' in the
    introduction in which the variables used for the taxonomy are more
    clearly stated (incentive, promoter, technology, population, ... ?)
    and used consistently all along the document. If there is interest
    to cook a bit more the classification in this sense, we can try to
    do it in this step by proposing two -or more- alternate drafts: one
    strictly based in what exists now, and may be another more
    ellaborated. Let me know if you think that this makes sense.<br>
    <br>
    Best regards<br>
    <br>
    Javier<br>

        <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"
            lang="EN-US">The idea of this draft is to set a clear
            "classification" or a "taxonomy" of Alternative Network
            Deployments.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
        <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"

        <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"
            lang="EN-US">We have three possible approaches:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
        <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"
            lang="EN-US"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
        <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"
            lang="EN-US">(1) To write a draft including everything, i.e.
            the classification itself and very long explaining about
            each kind of network. This would be a fat document
            including everything. The drawback of this approach:
            Consensus will be very difficult to reach, because we can
            get blocked in many parts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
        <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"

        <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"
            lang="EN-US">(2) To split the draft into a number of
            different documents (with different authors), each one about
            one kind of Alternative Network. The classification could be
            something like:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
        <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"
            lang="EN-US">- Community Networks<o:p></o:p></span></p>
        <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"
            lang="EN-US">- Crowdshared approaches, led by the people and
            third party stakeholders<o:p></o:p></span></p>
        <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"
            lang="EN-US">- User-centric Networks <o:p></o:p></span></p>
        <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"
            lang="EN-US">- Testbed<o:p></o:p></span></p>
        <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"
            lang="EN-US"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
        <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"
            lang="EN-US">Drawback: If we just split the current draft
            into a number of documents, we may lose the classification.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
        <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"
            lang="EN-US"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
        <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"
            lang="EN-US"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
        <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"
            lang="EN-US">(3) A thin "classification" draft and some
            other "fat" ones explaining each kind of Alternative
            Networks. Perhaps we could keep the initial draft "thin"
            enough so as to permit other ones further exploring and
            explaining each kind of network in deep.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
        <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"
            lang="EN-US"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
        <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"
            lang="EN-US"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
        <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"
            lang="EN-US">Currently, the authors of the draft think that
            the most practical approach could be (3): let's start with a
            classification, and see if we can find people for writing
            the other ones. Following this approach, the strength of the
            Alternative Network Deployments document will be the
            classification, not a very deep explaining about each kind
            of network.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

                we also write more on TVWS - about geolocation databases
                and why using proprietary databases may not be the right
                way forward to connect rural areas in developing regions
                - and whether cognitive sensing could be used because
                there is enough spectrum along with the spectrum masking
                details etc?.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Hi Jose,

A few comments, inline:

I'll note that consensus is not required in the IRTF. Nice to have, but =

The taxonomy and identification of meaningful ways to distinguish =
between network types is one of the most valuable aspects, so I wouldn't =
want to see an approach that resulted in losing that.

As I said, I think the classification is the thing of value here. =
Combined with some detail about the different network types and =
extensive references to examples of those networks and further =
information, this would be a valuable document. I think I'm arguing for =
thin, but not too thin!

the classification, not a very deep explaining about each kind of =
network.


Classification, an overview of the different network types including =
defining characteristics and maybe common issues, and extensive pointers =
to further information would be useful, IMHO.

Dear Arjuna,
I know that someone was asking this before... Will there be a chance to 
participate remotely?
If that is not an option, is there a chance to get at least the audio 
records of the meetings?

Thanks
Samo

An interesting post on the 'digital chasm':

http://pacificopendata.com/2014/11/the-digital-divide-is-a-chasm/

"The ITU, bless their binary souls, just released the 2014 Measuring the =
Information Society report. The headline is =E2=80=93 or should be =E2=80=93=
 that something is very wrong on the internet, and we need to fix it.

I used to scoff at the phrase =E2=80=98digital divide=E2=80=99, which =
was used to soft-peddle the glaring technological inequalities between =
rich and poor nations. I still don=E2=80=99t like it, but for different =
reasons. I used to think that the technological gap between the =
developed and developing was evanescent, a transient blip which would =
rapidly disappear as wireless broadband technologies proved viable in =
even the most marginal markets.

Not so. At least, not so far. The 2014 ITU report shows a widening gap =
between rich and poor, in spite of the fact that growth in the global =
digital economy is driven entirely by the developing world."=

All -

just to update -

Facebook will be hosting a reception straight after our GAIA workshop
on Dec 4th. We have invited folks from the Internet.org to attend and
we are trying to see if one of them can give a talk at the GAIA
workshop. Marco and I are visiting Facebook and meeting the
Internet.org folks the day before. My specific agenda will to talk
about GAIA and its related activities and to see if we can engage with
them.

Also the agenda has been updated slightly with a change of talk:
