so there's all sorts of weird new access tech, like there's two zigbee
nets in my house alone, plus community mesh - what do people measure
on those? Most the hard work in last few years has been on
pay-per-use nets or broadband tech of the legacy (adsl, cable modem,
and cellular data)  - but i guess the question here is what are the
weird and wonderful lashups occuring out of cheap & cheerful, as well
as the ever onwards march to fiber to the eye+ear, no?

******************************************************************

CALL FOR PAPERS AND DEMOS

7th Extreme Conference on Communication and Computing - The Mendonoma
Expedition
ExtremeCom 2016

14-19 August 2016, Manchester, Medocino county, CA, USA

http://www.extremecom.org/

******************************************************************

Scope
-----

The Extreme Conference on Communication and Computing (ExtremeCom) brings
together researchers and practitioners in areas related to communications in
rural, remote or other extreme environments, and computing in extreme
operating conditions such as extreme temperatures and energy constraints,
extreme quantities ("big data"), extremely large-scale systems, and extreme
levels of threat and uncertainty, in order to gain experience and insight
into
the challenges that such environments pose for the network and the users.

We welcome a broad range of topics concerning both technical and economical
aspects, for example wireless communication, mobile computing, low power
devices and protocols, delay tolerant networks and other networking
paradigms,
distributed computing paradigms, big data, distributed systems, cloud
computing, business and services models, user experiences and web
applications. Researches addressing computing challenges in general mobile
environments (even not completely extreme) are also welcomed by the
conference.

Following on from the success of ExtremeCom 2009 - The Midnight Sun
Expedition
in Laponia, Sweden, ExtremeCom 2010 - The Himalayan Expedition in Dharamsala,
India, ExtremeCom 2011 - The Amazon Expedition in Manaus, Brazil, ExtremeCom
2012 - The Swiss Alps Winter Expedition in Zurich, Switzerland, ExtremeCom
2013 - The Volcanic Expedition in the Eyjafjallajökull Volcano region in
Iceland, and ExtremeCom 2014 - The Galapagos Expedition in Ecuador, we
present
the ExtremeCom 2016 edition: The Mendonoma Expedition. The conference will
contain 3 days of excursions in the stunning nature of coastal northern
California (Mendocino county). Along the way, participants will get to see
and
experience the varying landscape and visit coastal areas, explore the
Stornetta lands national monument, and hike to the Point Arena hot springs
along the Garcia river. During these excursions, we will visit the landing
site of the original trans-pacific coaxial cables, which is today one of
North-America's most important transoceanic fiber landing station, as well as
several deployment sites of the FurtherReach.Net rural network where
participants will interact with subscribers, operators and developers of this
service to learn from their experience. The immersion will not only give a
better idea of both the technical and user requirements of such rural
deployments, but it will also give many opportunities for informal research
discussions between the participants. Participants that have their own
software for scenarios like this will also, to as great an extent as
possible,
be encouraged to test and demonstrate it within this environment. After the
excursions, there will be two days of paper presentations and demos. Focus
will still be on informal research discussions, with the hope that the field
experience will give participants the ability to discuss the topics in a new
light.

******************************************************************

Important dates
---------------

Submission deadline: May 24, 2016
Notification of acceptance: June 15, 2016
Early registration deadline: July 10, 2016
Registration deadline: July 21, 2016
Conference dates: August 14-19, 2016

Submission Guidelines
---------------------

Participants should submit 6 page papers about ideas and visions about the
topics of the conference or demo proposals to be shown during the conference.
Visionary and thought-provoking papers that are likely to generate much
discussion during the conference are especially solicited. The aim of the
conference is to maintain an informal environment, where new research ideas
can be discussed and developed. We will also have a demo session where
participants can show their implementations and systems. If you want to
show a
demo, please submit a 2 page demo proposal using the same submission
system as
for conference papers, including the prefix "Demo: " in the title.

We only accept PDF files, no greater than 6 pages in length (2 pages for the
demos), including text, figures and references. Manuscripts should use the
ACM
templates (for LaTeX, please use Option 2 files), with 9pt fonts.


Topics for the conference include, but are not limited to:
----------------------------------------------------------

* Testbeds for large-scale sustainable testing of mobile communication
systems
* Real deployments of networks in extreme environments
* Business and service models for networks in rural, remote, and other
  challenging environments
* Delay tolerant networking
* User experience research
* Big data research such as mining and modeling of mobility and social
network
* Cloud computing for extreme scalability
* Mesh networks and sensor networks
* Low-power and intermittent-power protocols
* Mechanisms for emergency and urgent communications
* Distributed computing for mobile environments
* Networked applications and services
* Operating system and middleware support for mobile computing and networking
* Security, privacy, and trustworthiness of extreme communications
* Underwater networking
* Robotic communications and mobile augmented reality
* Protocols, architectures, and applications for the Internet of Things

Due to logistics, the number of participants will be limited. Priority
will be
given to authors of papers and those who register first.

Hi,

Thanks to Jane Coffin for pointing me to this discussion.

You might also want to have a look at the RIPE Atlas system, a worldwide
active measurements network: https://atlas.ripe.net/

While we don't actually measure bandwidth, the thousands of RIPE Atlas
measurement probes regularly send pings and traceroutes (and also SSL,
DNS queries) to certain pre-defined destinations on the Internet.
Especially the traceroute results could be interesting for the questions
below.

The measurement results are public and are used by many researchers and
operators for various use cases. Have a look at this blog for some
inspiration: https://labs.ripe.net/atlas

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me directly.

Kind regards,
Mirjam Kuehne
RIPE NCC

Thanks a lot for that pointer too!
I know about the RIPE atlas and do find it very interesting.

However, probably I'm missing something - how is the traceroute dataset =
relevant for what I'm asking?
My question is about link bandwidth...

Hi Michael,

You are right: RIPE Atlas doesn't measure bandwidth but I thought
measuring latency could add another aspect to the question.

Kind regards,

Folks may also be interested in the BISmark project:
http://projectbismark.net/

We measure throughput from hundreds of home networks around the world in =
about 30 countries.  All of that data is available at =
http://uploads.projectbismark.net/

We also have a mobile throughput application:
http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=3Dcom.num

We=E2=80=99ve used these to study throughput in the US, South Africa, =
and Pakistan. In South Africa and Pakistan, we looked at both fixed line =
and mobile throughput.  Here are the relevant papers:

* US: http://goo.gl/p48tDr
* South Africa: http://goo.gl/kONyHu
* Pakistan: http://goo.gl/9RdzXK

Facebook's 2015 State Of Connectivity report is out:
http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2016/02/state-of-connectivity-2015-a-report-on-global-internet-access/

"In order to address the barriers to connectivity, corporations, 
governments, NGOs and non-profits need to work together to continue 
gathering more accurate data on the state of global connectivity, and 
develop global standards for collecting, reporting, and distributing 
this data.

As one example, Facebook is collaborating with the Center for 
International Earth Science Information Network at Columbia University 
to produce detailed maps showing the population distribution of 20 
countries. These maps were created using new machine learning techniques 
and show the most accurate estimates of population distribution and 
settlements available to date."

Hi Niels,

According to your review, we have built a new version of the draft. We =
have not uploaded it yet to the IETF web page.

This e-mail contains three attachments:

- These are your general comments, and our responses: =
General_Comments_Review_Niels.txt

- These are the detailed comments ([JS] means Jose Saldana), added to =
your review (marked with "#"): =
draft-irtf-gaia-alternative-network-deployments-03 edit NtO_JS2.txt

- And this would be the new version of the draft: =
draft-irtf-gaia-alternative-network-deployments-03c.txt


Thank you very much!

Jose

      Alternative Network Deployments: Taxonomy, characterization,
                     technologies and architectures
           draft-irtf-gaia-alternative-network-deployments-04

Abstract

   This document presents a taxonomy of "Alternative Network
   Deployments", i.e. a set of network access models that have emerged
   in the last decade to bring Internet connectivity to people, using
   topological, architectural and business models different from the
   mainstream ones.

   The document also surveys the technologies deployed in these
   networks, and their differing architectural characteristics,
   including a set of definitions and shared properties.

   The classification considers models such as Community Networks,
   Wireless Internet Service Providers (WISPs), networks owned by
   individuals but leased out to network operators who use them as a
   low-cost medium to reach the underserved population, and networks
   that provide connectivity by sharing wireless resources of the users.

1.  Introduction

   One of the aims of the Global Access to the Internet for All (GAIA)
   IRTF research group is "to document and share deployment experiences
   and research results to the wider community through scholarly
   publications, white papers, Informational and Experimental RFCs,
   etc."  In line with this objective, this document proposes a
   classification of "Alternative Network Deployments".  This term
   includes a set of network access models that have emerged in the last
   decade with the aim of providing Internet connection, following
   topological, architectural and business models that differ from the
   so-called "mainstream" ones, where a company deploys the
   infrastructure connecting the users, who pay a subscription fee to be
   connected and make use of it.

   Several initiatives throughout the world have built these large scale
   networks, using predominantly wireless technologies (including long
   distance) due to the reduced cost of using unlicensed spectrum.
   Wired technologies such as fiber are also used in some of these
   networks.

   The classification considers several types of alternate deployments:
   Community Networks are self-organized networks wholly owned by the
   community; networks acting as Wireless Internet Service Providers
   (WISPs); networks owned by individuals but leased out to network
   operators who use such networks as a low cost medium to reach the
   underserved population; and finally there are networks that provide
   connectivity by sharing wireless resources of the users.

   The emergence of these networks has been motivated by a variety of
   factors such as the lack of wired and cellular infrastructures in
   rural/remote areas [Pietrosemoli].  In some cases, alternative
   networks may provide more localized communication services as well as
   Internet backhaul support through peering agreements with mainstream
   network operators.  In other cases, they are built as a complement or
   an alternative to commercial Internet access provided by mainstream
   network operators.

   The present document is intended to provide a broad overview of
   initiatives, technologies and approaches employed in these networks,
   including some real examples.  References describing each kind of
   network are also provided.

1.1.  Mainstream networks

   In this document we will use the term "mainstream networks" to denote
   those networks sharing these characteristics:

   o  Regarding scale, they are usually large networks spanning entire
      regions.

   o  Top-down control of the network and centralized approaches are
      used.

   o  They require a substantial investment in infrastructure.

   o  Users in mainstream networks do not participate in the network
      design, deployment, operation and maintenance.

1.2.  Alternative Networks

   The term "Alternative Network" proposed in this document refers to
   the networks that do not share the characteristics of "mainstream
   network deployments".

2.  Terms used in this document

   This document follows a multidisciplinary approach, considering the
   multidisciplinary nature of the Internet and the problems being
   addressed.  Therefore, some concepts used in fields and disciplines
   different from networking are being used.  This subsection summarizes
   these terms, and the meaning being attributed to them.

   o  Developed and developing countries: Although there is no consensus
      on a precise definition for the term "developing country" [UN], it
      is generally used to refer to nations with a relatively lower
      standard of living.  Developing countries have also been defined
      as those which are in transition from the folk way of living
      towards the modern technology-driven way of living which began in
      the Industrial Revolution.  This distinction is normally intended
      to reflect basic economic country conditions, and in common
      practice, Japan in Asia, Canada and the United States in northern
      America, Australia and New Zealand in Oceania, and Europe are
      considered "developed" regions or areas [UN].

   o  The "Digital Divide".  The following dimensions are considered to
      be meaningful when measuring the digital development state of a
      country: infrastructures (availability and affordability),
      Information and Communications Technology (ICT) sector (human
      capital and technological industry), digital literacy, legal and
      regulatory framework and, content and services.  A lack of digital
      development in one or more of these dimensions is what has been
      referred as the "Digital Divide" [Norris].

   o  Rural zone.  The document will follow the definition of "rural "
      proposed by G.  P.  Wibberley in 1972 [Wibberley]: "The word
      describes those parts of a country which show unmistakable signs
      of being dominated by extensive uses of land, either at the
      present time or in the immediate past.  It is important to
      emphasise that these extensive uses might have had a domination
      over an area which has now gone because this allows us to look at
      settlements which to the eye still appear to be rural but which,
      in practice, are merely an extension of the city resulting from
      the development of the commuter train and the private motor car"
      [Clot].

   o  Urban zone.  The definition of "urban" does vary between
      countries, as shown in [UNStats].  For example, in the United
      States they are defined as "Agglomerations of 2 500 or more
      inhabitants, generally having population densities of 1 000
      persons per square mile or more."  In China the term "city" is
      proper of those designated by the State Council.  In Liberia they
      are "Localities of 2 000 or more inhabitants."  In France they are
      "communes containing an agglomeration of more than 2 000
      inhabitants living in contiguous houses or with not more than 200
      metres between houses."  In Guam, they are "agglomerations of 2
      500 or more inhabitants, generally having population densities of
      1 000 persons per square mile or more, referred to as "urban
      clusters"".

   o  Demand: In economics, it describes a consumer's desire and
      willingness to pay a price for a specific good or service.

   o  Provision is the act of making an asset available for sale.  In
      this document we will mainly use it as the act of making a network
      service available to the inhabitants of a zone.

   o  Underserved area.  Area in which the market permanently fails to
      provide the information and communications services demanded by
      the population.

   o  "Free Networks" (also called "Network Commons") [FNF].  A
      definition of Free Network is proposed by the Free Network
      Foundation (see https://thefnf.org) as the one that "equitably
      grants the following freedoms to all:

      *  Freedom 0 - The freedom to communicate for any purpose, without
         discrimination, interference, or interception.

      *  Freedom 1 - The freedom to grow, improve, communicate across,
         and connect to the whole network.

      *  Freedom 2- The freedom to study, use, remix, and share any
         network communication mechanisms, in their most reusable
         forms."

   o  The principles of Free, Open and Neutral Networks have also been
      summarized (see https://guifi.net/en/FONNC) this way:

      *  "You have the freedom to use the network for any purpose as
         long as you do not harm the operation of the network itself,
         the rights of other users, or the principles of neutrality that
         allow contents and services to flow without deliberate
         interference.

      *  You have the right to understand the network, to know its
         components, and to spread knowledge of its mechanisms and
         principles.

      *  You have the right to offer services and content to the network
         on your own terms.

      *  You have the right to join the network, and the responsibility
         to extend this set of rights to anyone according to these same
         terms."

3.  Scenarios where Alternative Networks are deployed

   Different studies have reported that as much as 60% of the people in
   the planet do not have Internet connectivity [Sprague],
   [InternetStats].  In addition, those unconnected are unevenly
   distributed: only 31 percent of the population in developing
   countries had access in 2014, against 80 percent in developed
   countries [WorldBank2016].  This is one of the reasons behind the
   inclusion of the objective of providing "significantly increase
   access to ICT and strive to provide universal and affordable access
   to internet in LDCs by 2020," as one of the targets in the
   Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [SDG], considered as a part of
   "Goal 9.  Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and
   sustainable industrialization and foster innovation."

   For the purpose of this document, a distinction between "developed"
   and "developing" zones is made, highlighting the factors related to
   ICT (Information and Communication Technologies), which can be
   quantified in terms of:

   o  The availability of both national and international bandwidth, as
      well as equipment.

   o  The difficulty to pay for the services and the devices required to
      access the ICTs.

   o  The instability and or lack of power supply.

   o  The scarcity of qualified staff.

   o  The existence of a policy and regulatory framework that hinders
      the development of these models in favor of state monopolies or
      incumbents.

   In this context, the World Summit of the Information Society, aims at
   achieving "a people-centred, inclusive and development-oriented
   Information Society, where everyone can create, access, utilize and
   share information and knowledge.  Therefore, enabling individuals,
   communities and people to achieve their full potential in promoting
   their sustainable development and improving their quality of life".
   It also called upon "governments, private sector, civil society and
   international organizations" to actively engage to work towards the
   bridging of the digital divide [WSIS].

   Some Alternative Networks have been deployed in underserved areas,
   where citizens may be compelled to take a more active part in the
   design and implementation of ICT solutions.  However, Alternative
   Networks are also present in some developed countries, being built as
   an alternative to commercial ones managed by mainstream network
   operators.

   The consolidation of a number of mature Alternative Networks (e.g.
   Community Networks) sets a precedent for civil society members to
   become more active in the search for alternatives to provide
   themselves with affordable access.  Furthermore, Alternative Networks
   could contribute to other dimensions of the digital development like
   increased human capital and the creation of content and services
   targeting the locality of each network.

3.1.  Urban vs. Rural Areas

   The differences presented in the previous section are not only
   present between countries, but within them too.  This is especially
   the case for rural inhabitants, who represent approximately 55% of
   the world's population [IFAD2011], 78% of them in developing
   countries [ITU2011].  According to the World Bank, adoption gaps
   "between rural and urban populations are falling for mobile phones
   but increasing for the internet" [WorldBank2016].

   Although it is impossible to generalize among them, there exist some
   common features in rural areas that have prevented incumbent
   operators for providing access and that, at the same time, challenge
   the deployment of alternative infrastructures [Brewer], [Nungu],
   [Simo_c].

   These challenges include:

   o  Low per capita income, as the local economy is mainly based on
      subsistence agriculture, farming and fishing.

   o  Scarcity or absence of basic infrastructure, such as electricity,
      water and access roads.

   o  Low population density and distance (spatial or affective) between
      population clusters.

   o  Underdeveloped social services, such as healthcare and education.

   o  Lack of adequately educated and trained technicians, and high
      potential for those trained to migrate due to lack of
      opportunities and low salaries in rural areas, or to start their
      own companies [McMahon].

   o  High cost of Internet access [Mathee].

   o  Harsh environments leading to failure in electronic communication
      devices [Johnson].

   However, the proliferation of urban Community Networks, where
   scarcity of spectrum, scale, and heterogeneity of devices pose
   certain challenges to their stability and the services they aim to
   provide, has fuelled the creation of low-cost, low-consumption, low-
   complexity off-the-shelf wireless devices.  These devices can
   simplify the deployment and maintenance of alternative
   infrastructures in rural areas.

3.2.  Topology patterns followed by Alternative Networks

   Alternative Networks, considered self-managed and self-sustained,
   follow different topology patterns [Vega].  Generally, these networks
   grow spontaneously and organically, that is, the network grows
   without specific planning and deployment strategy and the routing
   core of the network tends to fit a power law distribution.  Moreover,
   these networks are composed of a high number of heterogeneous devices
   with the common objective of freely connecting and increasing the
   network coverage.  Although these characteristics increase the
   entropy (e.g., by increasing the number of routing protocols), they
   have resulted in an inexpensive solution to effectively increase the
   network size.  One example corresponds to Guifi.net [Vega] with an
   exponential growth rate in the number of operating nodes during the
   last decade.

   Regularly, rural areas in these networks are connected through long-
   distance links (the so-called community mesh approach) which in turn
   conveys the Internet connection to relevant organizations or
   institutions.  In contrast, in urban areas, users tend to share and
   require mobile access.  Since these areas are also likely to be
   covered by commercial ISPs, the provision of wireless access by
   Virtual Operators like [Fon] may constitute a way to extend the user
   capacity to the network.  Other proposals like Virtual Public
   Networks [Sathiaseelan_a] can also extend the service.

4.  Classification criteria

   The classification of Alternative Network Deployments, presented in
   this document, is based on the following criteria:

4.1.  Commercial model / promoter

   The entity (or entities) or individuals promoting an Alternative
   Network can be:

   o  A community of users.

   o  A public stakeholder.

   o  A private company.

   o  Supporters of a crowdshared approach.

   o  A community that already owns some infrastructure shares it with
      an operator, which uses it for backhauling purposes.

   o  A research or academic entity.

4.2.  Goals and motivation

   Alternative Networks can also be classified according to the
   underlying motivation for them, e.g., addressing deployment and usage
   hurdles:

   o  Reducing initial capital expenditures (for the network and the end
      user, or both).

   o  Providing additional sources of capital (beyond the traditional
      carrier-based financing).

   o  Reducing on-going operational costs (such as backhaul or network
      administration)

   o  Leveraging expertise.

   o  Reducing hurdles to adoption (digital literacy; literacy in
      general; relevance, etc.)

   o  Extending coverage to underserved areas (users and communities).

   o  Network neutrality guarantees.

4.3.  Administrative model

   o  Centralized, where a single authority (e.g. a company, a public
      stakeholder) plans and manages the network.

   o  Non-centralized, i.e. the network is managed following a
      distributed approach, in which a whole community may participate.
      The network may also grow according to the fact of new users
      joining it, but not following a plan.

4.4.  Technologies employed

   o  Standard Wi-Fi.  Many Alternative Networks are based on the
      standard IEEE 802.11 [IEEE.802-11-2012] using the Distributed
      Coordination Function.

   o  Wi-Fi modified for long distances (WiLD), either with CSMA/CA or
      with an alternative TDMA MAC [Simo_b].

   o  802.16-compliant (WiMax) [IEEE.802-16.2008] systems over non-
      licensed bands.

   o  Dynamic Spectrum Solutions (e.g. based on the use of white
      spaces), a set of television frequencies that can be utilized by
      secondary users in locations where they are unused, e.g., IEEE
      802.11af [IEEE.802-11AF.2013] or 802.22 [IEEE.802-22.2011].

   o  Satellite solutions can also be employed to give coverage to wide
      areas.

   o  Low-cost optical fiber systems are used to connect households in
      some villages.

4.5.  Typical scenarios

   The scenarios where Alternative Networks are usually deployed can be
   classified as:

   o  Urban / Rural areas.

   o  Developed / developing countries.

5.  Classification of Alternative Networks

   This section classifies Alternative Networks according to the
   criteria explained previously.  Each of them has different incentive
   structures, maybe common technological challenges, but most
   importantly interesting usage challenges which feed into the
   incentives as well as the technological challenges.

   At the beginning of each subsection, a table is presented including a
   classification of each network according to the criteria listed in
   the "Classification criteria" subsection.

   In some cases, real examples of Alternative Networks are cited.

   +--------------------+----------------------------------------------+

           Table 1: Community Networks' characteristics summary

   Community Networks are large-scale, non-centralized, self-managed
   networks sharing these characteristics:

   o  They start and grow organically, they are open to participation
      from everyone, sharing an open peering agreement.  Community
      members directly contribute active (not just passive) network
      infrastructure.  The network grows as new hosts and links are
      added.

   o  Knowledge about building and maintaining the network and ownership
      of the network itself is non-centralized and open.  There is an
      shared platform (e.g.  a web site) where a minimum coordination is
      performed.  This way, community members with the right permissions
      have an obvious and direct form of organizational control over the
      overall operation of the network (e.g.  IP addresses, routing,
      etc.) in their community (not just their own participation in the
      network).

   o  The network can serve as a backhaul for providing a whole range of
      services and applications, from completely free to even commercial
      services.

   Hardware and software used in Community Networks can be very diverse,
   even inside one network.  A Community Network can have both wired and
   wireless links.  Multiple routing protocols or network topology
   management systems may coexist in the network.

   These networks grow organically, since they are formed by the
   aggregation of nodes belonging to different users.  A minimal
   governance infrastructure is required in order to coordinate IP
   addressing, routing, etc.  An example of this kind of Community
   Network is described in [Braem].  These networks follow a
   participatory model, which has been shown effective in connecting
   geographically dispersed people, thus enhancing and extending digital
   Internet rights.

   The fact of the users adding new infrastructure (i.e. extensibility)
   can be used to formulate another definition: A Community Network is a
   network in which any participant in the system may add link segments
   to the network in such a way that the new segments can support
   multiple nodes and adopt the same overall characteristics as those of
   the joined network, including the capacity to further extend the
   network.  Once these link segments are joined to the network, there
   is no longer a meaningful distinction between the previous and the
   new extent of the network.

   In Community Networks, profit can only be made by offering services
   and not simply by supplying the infrastructure, because the
   infrastructure is neutral, free, and open (mainstream Internet
   Service Providers base their business on the control of the
   infrastructure).  In Community Networks, everybody keeps the
   ownership of what he/she has contributed.

   The majority of Community Networks comply with the definition of Free
   Network, included in Section 2 .

   +----------------+--------------------------------------------------+

                  Table 2: WISPs' characteristics summary

   WISPs are commercially-operated wireless Internet networks that
   provide Internet and/or Voice Over Internet (VoIP) services.  They
   are most common in areas not covered by mainstream telcos or ISPs.
   WISPs mostly use wireless point-to-multipoint links using unlicensed
   spectrum but often must resort to licensed frequencies.  Use of
   licensed frequencies is common in regions where unlicensed spectrum
   is either perceived to be crowded, or too unreliable to offer
   commercial services, or where unlicensed spectrum faces regulatory
   barriers impeding its use.

   Most WISPs are operated by local companies responding to a perceived
   market gap.  There is a small but growing number of WISPs, such as
   AirJaldi [Airjaldi] in India that have expanded from local service
   into multiple locations.

   Since 2006, the deployment of cloud-managed WISPs has been possible
   with hardware from companies such as Meraki and later OpenMesh and
   others.  Until recently, however, most of these services have been
   aimed at industrialized markets.  Everylayer [Everylayer], launched
   in 2014, is the first cloud-managed WISP service aimed at emerging
   markets.

   +----------------+--------------------------------------------------+

          Table 3: Shared infrastructure characteristics summary

   In conventional networks, the operator usually owns the
   telecommunications infrastructure required for the service, or
   sometimes rents infrastructure to/from other companies.  The problem
   arises in large areas with low population density, in which neither
   the operator nor other companies have deployed infrastructure and
   such deployments are not likely to happen due to the low potential
   return on investment.

   When users already own deployed infrastructure, either individually
   or as a community, sharing that infrastructure with an operator can
   benefit both parties and is a solution that has been deployed in some
   areas.  For the operator, this provides a significant reduction in
   the initial investment needed to provide services in small rural
   localities because capital expenditure is only associated with the
   access network.  Renting capacity in the users' network for
   backhauling only requires an increment in the operating expenditure.
   This approach also benefits the users in two ways: they obtain
   improved access to telecommunications services that would not be
   accessible otherwise, and they can derive some income from the
   operator that helps to offset the network's operating costs,
   particularly for network maintenance.

   One clear example of the potential of the "shared infrastructure
   model" nowadays is the deployment of 3G services in rural areas in
   which there is a broadband rural community network.  Since the
   inception of femtocells (small, low-power cellular base stations),
   there are complete technical solutions for low-cost 3G coverage using
   the Internet as a backhaul.  If a user or community of users has an
   IP network connected to the Internet with some excess capacity,
   placing a femtocell in the user premises benefits both the user and
   the operator, as the user obtains better coverage and the operator
   does not have to support the cost of the backhaul infrastructure.
   Although this paradigm was conceived for improved indoor coverage,
   the solution is feasible for 3G coverage in underserved rural areas
   with low population density (i.e. villages), where the number of
   simultaneous users and the servicing area are small enough to use
   low-cost femtocells.  Also, the amount of traffic produced by these
   cells can be easily transported by most community broadband rural
   networks.

   Some real examples can be referenced in the TUCAN3G project, (see
   http://www.ict-tucan3g.eu/) which deployed demonstrator networks in
   two regions in the Amazon forest in Peru.  In these networks
   [Simo_a], the operator and several rural communities cooperated to
   provide services through rural networks built up with WiLD links
   [WiLD].  In these cases, the networks belong to the public health
   authorities and were deployed with funds come from international
   cooperation for telemedicine purposes.  Publications that justify the
   feasibility of this approach can also be found on that website.

          Table 4: Crowdshared approaches characteristics summary

   These networks can be defined as a set of nodes whose owners share
   common interests (e.g. sharing connectivity; resources; peripherals)
   regardless of their physical location.  They conform to the following
   approach: the home router creates two wireless networks: one of them
   is normally used by the owner, and the other one is public.  A small
   fraction of the bandwidth is allocated to the public network, to be
   employed by any user of the service in the immediate area.  Some
   examples are described in [PAWS] and [Sathiaseelan_c].  Other
   examples are found in the networks created and managed by City
   Councils (e.g., [Heer]).  The "openwireless movement"
   (https://openwireless.org/) also promotes the sharing of private
   wireless networks.

   In the same way, some companies [Fon] promote the use of Wi-Fi
   routers with dual access: a Wi-Fi network for the user, and a shared
   one.  A user community is created, and people can join the network in
   different ways: they can buy a router, so they share their connection
   and in turn they get access to all the routers associated with the
   community.  Some users can even get some revenue every time another
   user connects to their Wi-Fi access point.  Users that are not part
   of the community can buy passes in order to use the network.  Some
   mainstream telecommunications operators collaborate with these
   communities, by including the functionality required to create the
   two access networks in their routers.  Some of these efforts are
   surveyed in [Shi]

   The elements involved in a crowd-shared network are summarized below:

   o  Interest: a parameter capable of providing a measure (cost) of the
      attractiveness of a node in a specific location, at a specific
      instance in time.

   o  Resources: A physical or virtual element of a global system.  For
      instance, bandwidth; energy; data; devices.

   o  The owner: End users who sign up for the service and share their
      network capacity.  As a counterpart, they can access another
      owners' home network capacity for free.  The owner can be an end
      user or an entity (e.g. operator; virtual operator; municipality)
      that is to be made responsible for any actions concerning his/her
      device.

   o  The user: a legal entity or an individual using or requesting a
      publicly available electronic communications' service for private
      or business purposes, without necessarily having subscribed to
      such service.

   o  The Virtual Network Operator (VNO): An entity that acts in some
      aspects as a network coordinator.  It may provide services such as
      initial authentication or registration, and eventually, trust
      relationship storage.  A VNO is not an ISP given that it does not
      provide Internet access (e.g. infrastructure; naming).  A VNO is
      not an Application Service Provider (ASP) either since it does not
      provide user services.  Virtual Operators may also be stakeholders
      with socio-environmental objectives.  They can be local
      governments, grass-roots user communities, charities, or even
      content operators, smart grid operators, etc.  They are the ones
      who actually run the service.

   o  Network operators, who have a financial incentive to lease out
      unused capacity [Sathiaseelan_b] at lower cost to the VNOs.

   VNOs pay the sharers and the network operators, thus creating an
   incentive structure for all the actors: the end users get money for
   sharing their network, the network operators are paid by the VNOs,
   who in turn accomplish their socio-environmental role.

                Table 5: Testbeds' characteristics summary

   In some cases, the initiative to start the network is not from the
   community, but from a research entity (e.g. a university), with the
   aim of using it for research purposes [Samanta], [Bernardi].

   The administration of these networks may start being centralized in
   most cases (administered by the academic entity) and may end up in a
   non-centralized model in which other local stakeholders assume part
   of the network administration [Rey].

6.  Technologies employed

6.1.  Wired

   In many (developed or developing) countries it may happen that
   national service providers decline to provide connectivity to tiny
   and isolated villages.  So in some cases the villagers have created
   their own optical fiber networks.  This is the case in Lowenstedt in
   Germany [Lowenstedt], or some parts of Guifi.net [Cerda-Alabern].

6.2.  Wireless

   The vast majority of Alternative Network Deployments are based on
   different wireless technologies [WNDW].  Below we summarize the
   options and trends when using these features in Alternative Networks.

6.2.1.  Media Access Control (MAC) Protocols for Wireless Links

   Different protocols for Media Access Control, which also include
   physical layer (PHY) recommendations, are widely used in Alternative
   Network Deployments.  Wireless standards ensure interoperability and
   usability to those who design, deploy and manage wireless networks.

   The standards used in the vast majority of Alternative Networks come
   from the IEEE Standard Association's IEEE 802 Working Group.
   Standards developed by other international entities can also be used,
   as e.g. the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI).

6.2.1.1.  802.11 (Wi-Fi)

   The standard we are most interested in is 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, as it
   defines the protocol for Wireless LAN.  It is also known as "Wi-Fi".
   The original release (a/b) was issued in 1999 and allowed for rates
   up to 54 Mbit/s.  The latest release (802.11ac) approved in 2013
   reaches up to 866.7 Mbit/s.  In 2012, the IEEE issued the 802.11-2012
   Standard that consolidates all the previous amendments.  The document
   is freely downloadable from IEEE Standards [IEEE].

   The MAC protocol in 802.11 is called CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple
   Access with Collision Avoidance) and was designed for short
   distances; the transmitter expects the reception of an acknowledgment
   for each transmitted unicast packet; if a certain waiting time is
   exceeded, the packet is retransmitted.  This behavior makes necessary
   the adaptation of several MAC parameters when 802.11 is used in long
   links [Simo_b].  Even with this adaptation, distance has a
   significant negative impact on performance.  For this reason, many
   vendors implement alternative medium access techniques that are
   offered alongside the standard CSMA/CA in their outdoor 802.11
   products.  These alternative proprietary MAC protocols usually employ
   some type of TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access).  Low cost
   equipment using these techniques can offer high throughput at
   distances above 100 kilometers.

6.2.1.2.  GSM

   GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications), from ETSI, has also
   been used in Alternative Networks as a Layer 2 option, as explained
   in [Mexican], [Village], [Heimerl].

6.2.1.3.  Dynamic Spectrum

   Some Alternative Networks make use of TV White Spaces - a set of UHF
   and VHF television frequencies that can be utilized by secondary
   users in locations where they are unused by licensed primary users
   such as television broadcasters.  Equipment that makes use of TV
   White Spaces is required to detect the presence of existing unused TV
   channels by means of a spectrum database and/or spectrum sensing in
   order to ensure that no harmful interference is caused to primary
   users.  In order to smartly allocate interference-free channels to
   the devices, cognitive radios are used which are able to modify their
   frequency, power and modulation techniques to meet the strict
   operating conditions required for secondary users.

   The use of the term "White Spaces" is often used to describe "TV
   White Spaces" as the VHF and UHF television frequencies were the
   first to be exploited on a secondary use basis.  There are two
   dominant standards for TV white space communication: (i) the 802.11af
   standard [IEEE.802-11AF.2013] - an adaptation of the 802.11 standard
   for TV white space bands and (ii) the IEEE 802.22 standard
   [IEEE.802-22.2011] for long-range rural communication.

6.2.1.3.1.  802.11af

   802.11af [IEEE.802-11AF.2013] is a modified version of the 802.11
   standard operating in TV White Space bands using Cognitive Radios to
   avoid interference with primary users.  The standard is often
   referred to as White-Fi or "Super Wi-Fi" and was approved in February
   2014. 802.11af contains much of the advances of all the 802.11
   standards including recent advances in 802.11ac such as up to four
   bonded channels, four spatial streams and very high rate 256-QAM
   modulation but with improved in-building penetration and outdoor
   coverage.  The maximum data rate achievable is 426.7 Mbps for
   countries with 6/7 MHz channels and 568.9 Mbps for countries with 8
   MHz channels.  Coverage is typically limited to 1km although longer
   range at lower throughput and using high gain antennas will be
   possible.

   Devices are designated as enabling stations (Access Points) or
   dependent stations (clients).  Enabling stations are authorized to
   control the operation of a dependent station and securely access a
   geolocation database.  Once the enabling station has received a list
   of available white space channels it can announce a chosen channel to
   the dependent stations for them to communicate with the enabling
   station. 802.11af also makes use of a registered location server - a
   local database that organizes the geographic location and operating
   parameters of all enabling stations.

6.2.1.3.2.  802.22

   802.22 [IEEE.802-22.2011] is a standard developed specifically for
   long range rural communications in TV white space frequencies and
   first approved in July 2011.  The standard is similar to the 802.16
   (WiMax) [IEEE.802-16.2008] standard with an added cognitive radio
   ability.  The maximum throughput of 802.22 is 22.6 Mbps for a single
   8 MHz channel using 64-QAM modulation.  The achievable range using
   the default MAC scheme is 30 km, however 100 km is possible with
   special scheduling techniques.  The MAC of 802.22 is specifically
   customized for long distances - for example, slots in a frame
   destined for more distant Consumer Premises Equipment (CPEs) are sent
   before slots destined for nearby CPEs.

   Base stations are required to have a Global Positioning System (GPS)
   and a connection to the Internet in order to query a geolocation
   spectrum database.  Once the base station receives the allowed TV
   channels, it communicates a preferred operating white space TV
   channel with the CPE devices.  The standard also includes a co-
   existence mechanism that uses beacons to make other 802.22 base
   stations aware of the presence of a base station that is not part of
   the same network.

7.  Upper layers

7.1.  Layer 3

7.1.1.  IP addressing

   Most known Alternative Networks started in or around the year 2000.
   IPv6 was fully specified by then, but almost all Alternative Networks
   still use IPv4.  A survey [Avonts] indicated that IPv6 rollout
   presents a challenge to Community Networks.

   Most Community Networks use private IPv4 address ranges, as defined
   by [RFC1918].  The motivation for this was the lower cost and the
   simplified IP allocation because of the large available address
   ranges.

7.1.2.  Routing protocols

   As stated in previous sections, Alternative Networks are composed of
   possibly different layer 2 devices, resulting in a mesh of nodes.
   Connection between different nodes is not guaranteed and the link
   stability can vary strongly over time.  To tackle this, some
   Alternative Networks use mesh network routing protocols while other
   networks use more traditional routing protocols.  Some networks
   operate multiple routing protocols in parallel.  For example, they
   use a mesh protocol inside different islands and use traditional
   routing protocols to connect these islands.

7.1.2.1.  Traditional routing protocols

   The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), as defined by [RFC4271] is used by
   a number of Community Networks, because of its well-studied behavior
   and scalability.

   For similar reasons, smaller networks opt to run the Open Shortest
   Path First (OSPF) protocol, as defined by [RFC2328].

7.1.2.2.  Mesh routing protocols

   A large number of Alternative Networks use the Optimized Link State
   Routing Protocol (OLSR) as defined in [RFC3626].  The pro-active link
   state routing protocol is a good match with Alternative Networks
   because it has good performance in mesh networks where nodes have
   multiple interfaces.

   The Better Approach To Mobile Adhoc Networking (BATMAN) [Abolhasan]
   protocol was developed by members of the Freifunk community.  The
   protocol handles all routing at layer 2, creating one bridged
   network.

   Parallel to BGP, some networks also run the BatMan-eXperimental
   (BMX6) protocol [Neumann].  This is an advanced version of the BATMAN
   protocol which is based on IPv6 and tries to exploit the social
   structure of Alternative Networks.

7.2.  Transport layer

7.2.1.  Traffic Management when sharing network resources

   When network resources are shared (as e.g. in the networks explained
   in Section 5.4), special care has to be taken with the management of
   the traffic at upper layers.  From a crowdshared perspective, and
   considering just regular TCP connections during the critical sharing
   time, the Access Point offering the service is likely to be the
   bottleneck of the connection.  This is the main concern of sharers,
   having several implications.  There should be an adequate Active
   Queue Management (AQM) mechanism that implements a Lower-than-best-
   effort (LBE) [RFC6297] policy for the user and protects the sharer.
   Achieving LBE behavior requires the appropriate tuning of the well
   known mechanisms such as Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)
   [RFC3168], or Random Early Detection (RED) [RFC2309], or other more
   recent AQM mechanisms such as Controlled Delay (CoDel) and
   [I-D.ietf-aqm-codel] PIE (Proportional Integral controller Enhanced)
   [I-D.ietf-aqm-pie] that aid low latency.

7.3.  Services provided

   This section provides an overview of the services between hosts
   inside the network.  They can be divided into Intranet services,
   connecting hosts between them, and Internet services, connecting to
   nodes outside the network.

7.3.1.  Intranet services

   Intranet services can include, but are not limited to:

   o  VoIP (e.g. with SIP).

   o  Remote desktop (e.g. using my home computer and my Internet
      connection when I am away).

   o  FTP file sharing (e.g. distribution of software and media).

   o  P2P file sharing.

   o  Public video cameras.

   o  DNS.

   o  Online games servers.

   o  Jabber instant messaging.

   o  IRC chat.

   o  Weather stations.

   o  NTP.

   o  Network monitoring.

   o  Videoconferencing / streaming.

   o  Radio streaming.

   o  Message / Bulletin board.

7.3.2.  Access to the Internet

7.3.2.1.  Web browsing proxies

   A number of federated proxies may provide web browsing service for
   the users.  Other services (file sharing, VoIP, etc.) are not usually
   allowed in many Alternative Networks due to bandwidth limitations.

7.3.2.2.  Use of VPNs

   Some "micro-ISPs" may use the network as a backhaul for providing
   Internet access, setting up VPNs from the client to a machine with
   Internet access.

      Alternative Network Deployments: Taxonomy, characterization,
                     technologies and architectures
           draft-irtf-gaia-alternative-network-deployments-03


Abstract

# Can be quite a bit shorter. Especially the first half can be quite =
drastically reduced. It also copies a lot from the introduction.=20
[JS] We have shortened the abstract


   This document presents a taxonomy of "Alternative Network
   Deployments", and a set of definitions and shared properties.  It
   also surveys the technologies employed=20

# I find the usage of employed a bit strange here, but understand from =
native english speakers that it's OK, I would rather go for 'deployed'.
[JS] Changed

   in these networks, and their
   differing architectural characteristics.

   <The term "Alternative Network Deployments" includes a set of network
   access models that have emerged in the last decade.  These networks
   aim to bring Internet connectivity to people, using topological,
   architectural and business models different from the so-called
   "traditional" ones,>

# Perhaps use 'mainstream' instead of traditional. Following sentences =
can be dropped.
[JS] We have used "mainstream" on the whole document


   where a company deploys or leases the network
   infrastructure for connecting the users, who pay a subscription fee
   to be connected and make use of it.

   Several initiatives throughout the world have built large scale
   Alternative Networks, using predominantly wireless technologies
   (including long distance) due to the reduced cost of using unlicensed
   spectrum. =20


# Not dynamically managed? Perhaps for future proofing.=20
[JS] This sentence does not appear in the current version

   Wired technologies such as fiber are also used in some of
   these alternate networks.

# If fiber and wireless is used, perhaps not describe in abstract.
[JS] Removed in this version


   The emergence of these networks has been motivated by a variety of
   factors=20

# Following part needs to be reduced, doesn't seem relevant for =
abstract.
[JS] Removed.

   such as the reluctance of network operators to provide wired
   and cellular infrastructures to rural/remote areas.  In these cases,
   the networks have self-sustaining business models that provide more
   localized communication services as well as Internet backhaul support
   through peering agreements with traditional network operators.  In
   other cases, networks are built as a complement to commercial
   Internet access provided by "traditional" network operators.

   The present classification considers extant network models such as
   Community Networks, which are self-organized and decentralized

# Decentralized is a complicated / contested term rendering it a bit =
meaningless, define or change.
[JS] Sentence removed in this version


   networks wholly owned by the community; networks owned by individuals
   who act as Wireless Internet Service Providers (WISPs);=20

# Why can WISPs not be done by a community? Or a group? Or a not for =
profit company?
[JS] Currently it only says "Wireless Internet Service Providers =
(WISPs)"


   networks
   owned by individuals but leased out to network operators who use them
   as a low-cost medium to reach the underserved population, and finally
   there are networks that provide connectivity by sharing wireless
   resources of the users.



# Not sure what this classification adds to the abstract.
[JS] Removed the whole paragraph.

   Different criteria are used in order to build a classification e.g.,
   the ownership of the equipment, the way the network is organized, the
   participatory model, the extensibility,=20

# Extensibility in what sense?
[JS] Extensibility means "The fact of the users adding new =
infrastructure". Anyway, the paragraph has been removed.

   if they are driven by a
   community, a company or a local stakeholder (public or private), etc.


# Seems to be either redundant or different definition than provided =
above.=20
[JS] Removed

   According to the developed taxonomy, a characterization of each kind
   of network is presented in terms of specific network characteristics
   related to architecture, organization, etc.

# Ending an abstract with 'etc' doesn't seem appropriate.=20
[JS] Ok.

1.  Introduction

   Several initiatives throughout the world have built large scale
   networks, using predominantly wireless technologies (including long
   distance) due to the reduced cost of using unlicensed spectrum.
   Wired technologies such as fiber are also used in some of these
   alternate networks.  These networks constitute an alternative to
   traditional network operator deployments.

   There are several types of alternate deployments: Community Networks
   are self-organized and decentralized networks wholly owned by the
   community; networks owned by individuals who act as Wireless Internet
   Service Providers (WISPs); networks owned by individuals but leased
   out to network operators who use such networks as a low cost medium
   to reach the underserved population, and finally there are networks
   that provide connectivity by sharing wireless resources of the users.

   The emergence of these networks has been motivated by a variety of
   factors such as the reluctance of network operators to provide wired
   and cellular infrastructures to rural/remote areas [Pietrosemoli].
   In these cases, the networks have self-sustaining business models

# Business models don't seem part of the aim of this draft, perhaps =
better to leave references to it out.=20
[JS] The new version of the paragraph says:
       The emergence of these networks has been motivated by a variety =
of
       factors such as the reluctance of network operators to provide =
wired
       and cellular infrastructures to rural/remote areas =
[Pietrosemoli].
       In some cases, alternative networks may provide more localized
       communication services as well as Internet backhaul support =
through
       peering agreements with mainstream network operators.  In other
       cases, they are built as a complement or an alternative to =
commercial
       Internet access provided by mainstream network operators.

   that provide more localized communication services as well as
   Internet backhaul support through peering agreements with traditional
   network operators.  In other cases, they are built as a complement
   and an alternative to commercial Internet access provided by
   "traditional" network operators.

   One of the aims of the Global Access to the Internet for All (GAIA)
   IRTF research group is "to document and share deployment experiences
   and research results to the wider community through scholarly
   publications, white papers, Informational and Experimental RFCs,
   etc."  In line with this objective, this document proposes a
   classification of these "Alternative Network Deployments".  This term
   includes a set of network access models that have emerged in the last
   decade with the aim of bringing Internet connectivity to people,


# >>bringing Internet connectivity to people,<< strange use of wording, =
consider revision
[JS] The new version says "with the aim of providing Internet =
connection"

   following topological, architectural and business models that differ
   from the so-called "traditional" ones, where a company deploys the
   infrastructure connecting the users, who pay a subscription fee to be
   connected and make use of it.  The present document is intended to
   provide a broad overview of initiatives, technologies and approaches
   employed in these networks.  References describing each kind of
   network are also provided.


1.1.  Traditional networks

[JS] Now it says "mainstream" instead of "traditional"

   In this document we will use the term "traditional networks" to
   denote those sharing these characteristics:

   - Regarding scale, they are usually large networks spanning entire
   regions.

   - Top-down control of the network and centralized approaches are
   used.

   - They require a substantial investment in infrastructure.

   - Users in traditional networks tend to be passive consumers, as
   opposed to active stakeholders, in the network design, deployment,
   operation and maintenance.


# This sounds like a value judgement a bit more than a technical =
description.=20
[JS] The new version says:
        Users in mainstream networks do not participate
        in the network design, deployment, operation and maintenance.


1.2.  Alternative Networks

   The definition of an "alternative network" in this document is
   negative: a network that does not have the characteristics of
   "traditional networks".

# Negative is a normative judgement, perhaps better to use 'in contrast =
to mainstream network(s) / (deployments)'
[JS] The new version says:
        The term "alternative network" proposed in this document refers =
to the
        networks that do not share the characteristics of "mainstream =
network deployments".


2.  General Considerations Regarding Alternative Networks
[JS] This is now Section 3

   Alternative Network Deployments are present in every part of the
   world.  Even=20


# Why 'even' ?
[JS] The new version of this paragraph says:
       Some Alternative Networks have been deployed in underserved =
areas,
       where citizens may be compelled to take a more active part in the
       design and implementation of ICT solutions.  However, Alternative
       Networks are also present in some developed countries, being =
built as
       an alternative to commercial ones managed by mainstream network
       operators.



   in some high-income countries, these networks have been
   built as an alternative to commercial ones managed by traditional
   network operators.  This section discusses the scenarios where
   Alternative Networks are deployed.


2.1.  Digital Divide and Alternative Networks

   Although there is no consensus on a precise definition for the term
   "developing country", it is generally used to refer to nations with a
   relatively lower standard of living. =20

# These issues are part of extensive scientific debate accross several =
disciplines. It would be good to represent that debate here, including =
references, or refrain from making the point, because it is about the =
technical infrastructure.=20

[JS] This term is now defined in the Glossary:
   o  Developed and developing countries: Although there is no consensus
      on a precise definition for the term "developing country" [UN], it
      is generally used to refer to nations with a relatively lower
      standard of living.  Developing countries have also been defined
      as those which are in transition from the folk way of living
      towards the modern technology-driven way of living which began in
      the Industrial Revolution.  This distinction is normally intended
      to reflect basic economic country conditions, and in common
      practice, Japan in Asia, Canada and the United States in northern
      America, Australia and New Zealand in Oceania, and Europe are
      considered "developed" regions or areas [UN].


   Developing countries have also

   When it comes to quantify to which extent a country is a
   developing country, the Human Development Index has been proposed by
   the United Nations in order to consider the Gross National Income
   (GNI), the life expectancy and the education level of the population
   in a single indicator.  Additionally, the Gini Index (World Bank
   estimate) may be used to measure the inequality, as it estimates the
   dispersion of the national income (see
   http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.GINI).

   However, at the beginning of the 90's the debates about how to
   quantify development in a country were shaken by the appearance of
   Internet and mobile phones,=20

   The following
   dimensions are considered to be meaningful when measuring the digital
   development state of a country: infrastructures (availability and
   affordability); ICT (Information and Communications Technology)
   sector (human capital and technological industry); digital literacy;
   legal and regulatory framework; and content and services.  A lack of
   digital development in one or more of these dimensions is what has
   been referred as the Digital Divide.=20

   This divide is a new vector of
   inequality which - as occurred during the Industrial Revolution - may
   generate progress, but may create economic poverty and exclusion at
   the same time.  The Digital Divide is considered to be a consequence
   of other socio-economic divides, while, at the same time, a reason
   for their rise.

   In this context, the so-called "developing countries", in order not
   to be left behind by this incipient digital revolution, motivated the
   World Summit of the Information Society,=20

   which aimed at achieving "a
   people-centred, inclusive and development-oriented Information
   Society, where everyone can create, access, utilize and share
   information and knowledge, enabling individuals, communities and
   peoples to achieve their full potential in promoting their
   sustainable development and improving their quality of life" [WSIS],
   and called upon "governments, private sector, civil society and
   international organizations" to actively engage to accomplish it
   [WSIS].

   Most efforts from governments and international organizations
   initially focused on improving and extending the existing
   infrastructure in order not to leave their population behind.  As an
   example, one of the goals of the Digital Agenda for Europe [DAE] is
   "to increase regular internet usage from 60% to 75% by 2015, and from
   41% to 60% among disadvantaged people."

   Universal Access and Service plans have taken different forms in
   different countries over the years, with very uneven success rates,
   but in most cases inadequate to the scale of the problem.  Given this
   incapacity to solve the problem, some governments included Universal
   Service and Access obligations on mobile network operators when
   liberalizing the telecommunications market.  In combination with the
   overwhelming and unexpected uptake of mobile phones by poor people,

# 'Poor people' is probably not the best choice of wording.
[JS] Removed


   this has mitigated the low access indicators existing in many
   developing countries at the beginning of the 90s [Rendon].

   Although the contribution made by mobile network operators in
   decreasing the access gap is undeniable, their model presents some
   constraints that limit the development outcomes that increased
   connectivity promises to bring.  Prices, tailored for the more
   affluent part of the population, remain unaffordable to many, who
   invest large percentages of their disposable income in
   communications.  Additionally, the cost of prepaid packages, the only
   option available for the informal economies existing throughout
   developing countries, is high compared with the rate longer-term
   subscribers pay.

   The consolidation of many Alternative Networks (e.g.  Community
   Networks) in high income countries sets a precedent for civil society
   members from the so-called developing countries to become more active
   in the search for alternatives to provide themselves with affordable
   access. =20

2.2.  Urban vs. Rural Areas

   The Digital Divide presented in the previous section is not only
   present between countries, but within them too.  This is especially
   the case for rural inhabitants, who represent approximately 55% of
   the world's population, 78% of them in developing countries.

# Source?
[JS] The whole section has been rewritten.



   Although it is impossible to generalize among them, there exist some
   common features that have determined the availability of ICT
   infrastructure in these regions.  The disposable income of rural
   dwellers is lower than those inhabiting urban areas, with many
   surviving on a subsistence economy. =20

# Non-substantiated generalization.
[JS] The whole section has been rewritten.



   Many of them are located in
   geographies difficult to access and exposed to extreme weather
   conditions. =20

# Non-substantiated generalization.
[JS] The whole section has been rewritten.



   This has resulted in the almost complete lack of
   electrical infrastructure.  This context, together with relatively
   low population density, discourages telecommunications operators from
   providing similar services to those provided to urban dwellers, since
   they do not deem them profitable.

# Non-substantiated generalization.
[JS] The whole section has been rewritten.



   The cost of the wireless infrastructure required to set up a network,
   including powering it (e.g. via solar energy), is within the range of
   affordability,=20

# Non-substantiated generalization.
[JS] The whole section has been rewritten.


   if not of individuals then at least of entire
   communities.  The social capital existing in these areas can allow
   for Alternative Network set-ups where a reduced number of nodes may
   cover communities whose dwellers share the cost of the infrastructure
   and the gateway and access it via inexpensive wireless devices.  Some
   examples are presented in [Pietrosemoli] and [Bernardi].

   In this case, the lack of awareness and confidence of rural
   communities to embark on such tasks by themselves can become major
   barriers to their deployment. =20

# Sources?  Rhizomatica in Mexico might be an example of the opposite.=20
[JS] The whole section has been rewritten.


   Scarce technical skills in these
   regions have also been identified as a challenge to their success.
   However, the proliferation of urban Community Networks, where
   scarcity of spectrum, scale, and heterogeneity of devices pose
   tremendous challenges to their stability and the services they aim to
   provide, has fuelled the creation of robust low-cost, low-
   consumption, low-complexity off-the-shelf wireless devices.  These
   devices can simplify the deployment and maintenance of alternative
   infrastructures in rural areas.


2.3.  Gap between Demand and Provision of Communications Services

   Beyond the Digital Divide, either international or domestic, there
   are many situations in which the market fails to provide the
   information and communications services demanded by the population.

# Is this (necessarily) the role of the market?
[JS] A part of this text is now in the definition of "Underserved area"

   When this happens permanently in an area, citizens may be compelled
   to take a more active part in the design and implementation of ICT
   solutions, hence promoting Alternative Networks.

# This causality seems to be a bit too simplified. There are probably =
also other factors in play.=20
[JS] Removed.


2.4.  Topology patterns followed by Alternative Networks

   Alternative Networks, considered self-managed and self-sustained,
   follow different topology patterns [Vega].  Generally, these networks
   grow spontaneously and organically, that is, the network grows
   without specific planning and deployment strategy and the routing
   core of the network tends to fit a power law distribution.  Moreover,
   these networks are composed of a high number of heterogeneous devices
   with the common objective of freely connecting and increasing the
   network coverage.  Although these characteristics increase the
   entropy (e.g., by increasing the number of routing protocols), they
   have resulted in an inexpensive solution to effectively increase the
   network size.  One example corresponds to Guifi.net [Vega] with an
   exponential growth rate in the number of operating nodes during the
   last decade.

   Regularly, rural areas in these networks are connected through long-
   distance links (the so-called community mesh approach) which in turn
   conveys the Internet connection to relevant organizations or
   institutions.  In contrast, in urban areas, users tend to share and
   require mobile access.  Since these areas are also likely to be
   covered by commercial ISPs, the provision of wireless access by
   Virtual Operators like [Fon] may constitute a way to extend the user
   capacity to the network.  Other proposals like Virtual Public
   Networks [Sathiaseelan_a] can also extend the service.


3.  Classification criteria

   The classification of Alternative Network Deployments, presented in
   this document, is based on the following criteria:


3.1.  Commercial model / promoter

   The entity (or entities) or individuals promoting an Alternative
   Network can be:

   o  A community of users.
   o  A public stakeholder.
   o  A private company.
   o  Supporters of a crowdshared approach.
   o  A community that already owns some infrastructure shares it with
      an operator, which uses it for backhauling purposes.
   o  A research or academic entity.


3.2.  Goals and motivation

   Alternative networks can also be classified according to the
   underlying motivation for them, e.g., addressing deployment and usage
   hurdles:

   o  Reducing initial capital expenditures (for the network and the end
      user, or both).
   o  Providing additional sources of capital (beyond the traditional
      carrier-based financing).
   o  Reducing on-going operational costs (such as backhaul or network
      administration)
   o  Leveraging expertise.
   o  Reducing hurdles to adoption (digital literacy; literacy in
      general; relevance, etc.)
   o  Extending coverage to underserved areas (users and communities).
   o  Network neutrality guarantees.


3.3.  Administrative model

   o  Centralized.
   o  Distributed.

# Distributed is not necessarily the opposite of decentralized, right? =
Please provide more details.=20
[JS] This is the new version:
   o  Centralized, where a single authority (e.g. a company, a public
      stakeholder) plans and manages the network.

   o  Non-centralized, i.e. the network is managed following a
      distributed approach, in which a whole community may participate.
      The network may also grow according to the fact of new users
      joining it, but not following a plan.


3.4.  Technologies employed

   o  Standard Wi-Fi.
   o  Wi-Fi modified for long distances (WiLD), either with CSMA/CA or
      with an alternative TDMA MAC [Simo_b].
   o  802.16-compliant systems over non-licensed bands.
   o  Dynamic Spectrum Solutions (e.g. based on the use of white
      spaces).
   o  Satellite solutions.
   o  Low-cost optical fiber systems.

# Please provide a short explanation per bullet
[JS] this is the new version:

   o  Standard Wi-Fi.  Many Alternative Networks are based on the
      standard IEEE 802.11 [IEEE.802-11-2012] using the Distributed
      Coordination Function.

   o  Wi-Fi modified for long distances (WiLD), either with CSMA/CA or
      with an alternative TDMA MAC [Simo_b].

   o  802.16-compliant (WiMax) [IEEE.802-16.2008] systems over non-
      licensed bands.

   o  Dynamic Spectrum Solutions (e.g. based on the use of white
      spaces), a set of television frequencies that can be utilized by
      secondary users in locations where they are unused, e.g., IEEE
      802.11af [IEEE.802-11AF.2013] or 802.22 [IEEE.802-22.2011].

   o  Satellite solutions can also be employed to give coverage to wide
      areas.

   o  Low-cost optical fiber systems are used to connect households in
      some villages.


3.5.  Typical scenarios


   The scenarios where Alternative Networks are usually deployed can be:

   o  Urban.

   o  Rural.

   o  Rural in developing countries.

# What is the third bullet a seperate category?=20
[JS] This is the new version:

   The scenarios where Alternative Networks are usually deployed can be
   classified as:

   o  Urban / Rural areas.

   o  Developed / developing countries.



4.  Classification of Alternative Networks


   This section classifies Alternative Networks according to the
   criteria explained previously.  Each of them has different incentive
   structures, maybe common technological challenges, but most
   importantly interesting usage challenges which feed into the
   incentives as well as the technological challenges.

   At the beginning of each subsection, a table is presented including a
   classification of each network according to the criteria listed in
   the "Classification criteria" subsection.

   In some cases, real examples of Alternative Networks are cited.

           Table 1: Community Networks' characteristics summary


   Community Networks are large-scale, distributed, self-managed
   networks sharing these characteristics:

   - They are built and organized in a decentralized and open manner.

# Please explain what this concretely means
[JS] It is the same idea included in the next bullet. Removed.
[JS] This is the new version:
   - They start and grow organically, they are open to participation
   from everyone, sharing an open peering agreement.  Community members
   directly contribute active (not just passive) network infrastructure.
   The network grows as new hosts and links are added.

   - Knowledge about building and maintaining the network and ownership
   of the network itself is non-centralized and open.  There is an
   shared platform (e.g.  a web site) where a minimum coordination is
   performed.  This way, community members with the right permissions
   have an obvious and direct form of organizational control over the
   overall operation of the network (e.g.  IP addresses, routing, etc.)
   in their community (not just their own participation in the network).

   - The network can serve as a backhaul for providing a whole range of
   services and applications, from completely free to even commercial
   services.

[JS] See new version above


   - The network can serve as a backhaul for providing a whole range of
   services and applications, from completely free to even commercial
   services.

   Hardware and software used in Community Networks can be very diverse,
   even inside one network.  A Community Network can have both wired and
   wireless links.  Multiple routing protocols or network topology
   management systems may coexist in the network.

   These networks grow organically, since they are formed by the
   aggregation of nodes belonging to different users.  A minimal
   governance infrastructure is required in order to coordinate IP
   addressing, routing, etc.  An example of this kind of Community
   Network is described in [Braem].  These networks follow a
   participatory model, which has been shown effective in connecting
   geographically dispersed people, thus enhancing and extending digital
   Internet rights.

   The fact of the users adding new infrastructure (i.e. extensibility)
   can be used to formulate another definition: A Community Network is a
   network in which any participant in the system may add link segments
   to the network in such a way that the new segments can support
   multiple nodes and adopt the same overall characteristics as those of
   the joined network, including the capacity to further extend the
   network.  Once these link segments are joined to the network, there
   is no longer a meaningful distinction between the previous and the
   new extent of the network.

   In Community Networks, profit can only be made by offering services
   and not simply by supplying the infrastructure, because the
   infrastructure is neutral, free, and open (traditional Internet
   Service Providers base their business on the control of the
   infrastructure).  In Community Networks, everybody keeps the
   ownership of what he/she has contributed.

   Community Networks may also be called "Free Networks" or even
   "Network Commons" [FNF].  The majority of Community Networks comply
   with the definition of Free Network, included in the next subsection.


4.1.1.  Free Networks

   A definition of Free Network (which may be the same as Community
   Network) is proposed by the Free Network Foundation (see
   https://thefnf.org) as:

   "A free network equitably grants the following freedoms to all:

   Freedom 0 - The freedom to communicate for any purpose, without
   discrimination, interference, or interception.

   Freedom 1 - The freedom to grow, improve, communicate across, and
   connect to the whole network.

   Freedom 2- The freedom to study, use, remix, and share any network
   communication mechanisms, in their most reusable forms."

   The principles of Free, Open and Neutral Networks have also been
   summarized (see https://guifi.net/en/FONNC) this way:

   "- You have the freedom to use the network for any purpose as long as
   you do not harm the operation of the network itself, the rights of
   other users, or the principles of neutrality that allow contents and
   services to flow without deliberate interference.

   - You have the right to understand the network, to know its
   components, and to spread knowledge of its mechanisms and principles.

   - You have the right to offer services and content to the network on
   your own terms.

   - You have the right to join the network, and the responsibility to
   extend this set of rights to anyone according to these same terms."

# Why are Free Networks a subsection of Community Networks? Free =
Networks do not necessarily need to be Community Networks, right? It =
could also be publicly owned or by a not-for-profit, or even by a for =
profit company.

   +--------------------+----------------------------------------------+

                  Table 2: WISPs' characteristics summary


   WISPs are commercially-operated wireless Internet networks that
   provide Internet and/or Voice Over Internet (VoIP) services.  They
   are most common in areas not covered by traditional telcos or ISPs.
   WISPs mostly use wireless point-to-multipoint links using unlicensed
   spectrum but often must resort to licensed frequencies.  Use of
   licensed frequencies is common in regions where unlicensed spectrum
   is either perceived to be crowded, or too unreliable to offer
   commercial services, or where unlicensed spectrum faces regulatory
   barriers impeding its use.

   Most WISPs are operated by local companies responding to a perceived
   market gap.  There is a small but growing number of WISPs, such as
   AirJaldi [Airjaldi] in India that have expanded from local service
   into multiple locations.

# Isn't there an enormous growth in community ISPs now in India as well =
because fibre is offered to villages if they operate it themselves?
[JS] In this subsection we wanted to cover wireless Internet Service =
provision. Perhaps the case of fibre in India would fit into Community =
Networks. In fact, the table in 5.1. says Wi-Fi and optical Fibre.



   Since 2006, the deployment of cloud-managed WISPs has been possible
   with hardware from companies such as Meraki and later OpenMesh and
   others.  Until recently, however, most of these services have been
   aimed at industrialized markets.  Everylayer [Everylayer], launched
   in 2014, is the first cloud-managed WISP service aimed at emerging
   markets.

   +----------------+--------------------------------------------------+

          Table 3: Shared infrastructure characteristics summary


   In conventional networks, the operator usually owns the
   telecommunications infrastructure required for the service, or
   sometimes rents infrastructure to/from other companies.  The problem
   arises in large areas with low population density, in which neither
   the operator nor other companies have deployed infrastructure and
   such deployments are not likely to happen due to the low potential
   return on investment.

   When users already own deployed infrastructure, either individually
   or as a community, sharing that infrastructure with an operator can
   benefit both parties and is a solution that has been deployed in some
   areas.  For the operator, this provides a significant reduction in
   the initial investment needed to provide services in small rural
   localities because capital expenditure is only associated with the
   access network.  Renting capacity in the users' network for
   backhauling only requires an increment in the operating expenditure.
   This approach also benefits the users in two ways: they obtain
   improved access to telecommunications services that would not be
   accessible otherwise, and they can derive some income from the
   operator that helps to offset the network's operating costs,
   particularly for network maintenance.

   One clear example of the potential of the "shared infrastructure
   model" nowadays is the deployment of 3G services in rural areas in
   which there is a broadband rural community network.  Since the
   inception of femtocells

# suggested insert: (a small, low-power cellular base station)
[JS] Inserted. Thanks.


   there are complete technical solutions for
   low-cost 3G coverage using the Internet as a backhaul.  If a user or
   community of users has an IP network connected to the Internet with
   some excess capacity, placing a femtocell in the user premises
   benefits both the user and the operator, as the user obtains better
   coverage and the operator does not have to support the cost of the
   backhaul infrastructure.  Although this paradigm was conceived for
   improved indoor coverage, the solution is feasible for 3G coverage in
   underserved rural areas with low population density (i.e. villages),
   where the number of simultaneous users and the servicing area are
   small enough to use low-cost femtocells.  Also, the amount of traffic
   produced by these cells can be easily transported by most community
   broadband rural networks.

   Some real examples can be referenced in the TUCAN3G project, (see
   http://www.ict-tucan3g.eu/) which deployed demonstrator networks in
   two regions in the Amazon forest in Peru.  In these networks
   [Simo_a], the operator and several rural communities cooperated to
   provide services through rural networks built up with WiLD links
   [WiLD].  In these cases, the networks belong to the public health
   authorities and were deployed with funds come from international
   cooperation for telemedicine purposes.  Publications that justify the
   feasibility of this approach can also be found on that website.

          Table 4: Crowdshared approaches characteristics summary


   These networks can be defined as a set of nodes whose owners share
   common interests (e.g. sharing connectivity; resources; peripherals)
   regardless of their physical location.  They conform to the following
   approach: the home router creates two wireless networks: one of them
   is normally used by the owner, and the other one is public.  A small
   fraction of the bandwidth is allocated to the public network, to be
   employed by any user of the service in the immediate area.  Some
   examples are described in [PAWS] and [Sathiaseelan_c].  Other
   examples are found in the networks created and managed by City
   Councils (e.g., [Heer]).


# I think this was also the aim of the https://openwireless.org/ =
campaign
[JS] We have added a reference to openwireless:
       The "openwireless movement"
       (https://openwireless.org/) also promotes the sharing of private
       wireless networks.


   In the same way, some companies [Fon] develop and sell Wi-Fi routers
   with dual access: a Wi-Fi network for the user, and a shared one.  A
   user community is created, and people can join the network in
   different ways: they can buy a router, so they share their connection
   and in turn they get access to all the routers associated with the
   community.  Some users can even get some revenue every time another
   user connects to their Wi-Fi access point.  Users that are not part
   of the community can buy passes in order to use the network.  In some
   cases traditional telecommunications operators collaborate with these
   communities, by including the functionality required to create the
   two access networks in their routers.

[JS] We have improved the previous paragraph, adding a new reference.



   The elements involved in a crowd-shared network are summarized below:

   - Interest: a parameter capable of providing a measure (cost) of the
   attractiveness of a node in a specific location, at a specific
   instance in time.

   - Resources: A physical or virtual element of a global system.  For
   instance, bandwidth; energy; data; devices.

   - The owner: End users who sign up for the service and share their
   network capacity.  As a counterpart, they can access another owners'
   home network capacity for free.  The owner can be an end user or an
   entity (e.g. operator; virtual operator; municipality) that is to be
   made responsible for any actions concerning his/her device.

   - The user: a legal entity or an individual using or requesting a
   publicly available electronic communications' service for private or
   business purposes, without necessarily having subscribed to such
   service.

   - The Virtual Network Operator (VNO): An entity that acts in some
   aspects as a network coordinator.  It may provide services such as
   initial authentication or registration, and eventually, trust
   relationship storage.  A VNO is not an ISP given that it does not
   provide Internet access (e.g. infrastructure; naming).  A VNO is not
   an Application Service Provider (ASP) either since it does not
   provide user services.  Virtual Operators may also be stakeholders
   with socio-environmental objectives.  They can be local governments,
   grass-roots user communities, charities, or even content operators,
   smart grid operators, etc.  They are the ones who actually run the
   service.

   - Network operators, who have a financial incentive to lease out
   unused capacity [Sathiaseelan_b] at lower cost to the VNOs.
   VNOs pay the sharers and the network operators, thus creating an
   incentive structure for all the actors: the end users get money for
   sharing their network, the network operators are paid by the VNOs,
   who in turn accomplish their socio-environmental role.

                Table 5: Testbeds' characteristics summary

   In some cases, the initiative to start the network is not from the
   community, but from a research entity (e.g. a university), with the
   aim of using it for research purposes [Samanta], [Bernardi].

   The administration of these networks may start being centralized in
   most cases (administered by the academic entity) and may end up in a
   distributed model in which other local stakeholders assume part of
   the network administration [Rey].

# Under 3 (3.1, 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4, and 3.5) more options/configurations =
of networks are presented than discussed under 4. Why? Is the list under =
4 exhaustive of real world examples?
[JS] We do not think section 4 is exhaustive. We have added some =
examples, but it will never be exhaustive.




5.  Technologies employed

5.1.  Wired

   In many (developed or developing) countries it may happen that
   national service providers decline to provide connectivity to tiny
   and isolated villages.  So in some cases the villagers have created
   their own optical fiber networks.  This is the case in Lowenstedt in
   Germany [Lowenstedt], or some parts of Guifi.net [Cerda-Alabern].


5.2.  Wireless

   The vast majority of Alternative Network Deployments are based on
   different wireless technologies [WNDW].  Below we summarize the
   options and trends when using these features in Alternative Networks.


5.2.1.  Media Access Control (MAC) Protocols for Wireless Links

   Different protocols for Media Access Control, which also include
   physical layer (PHY) recommendations, are widely used in Alternative
   Network Deployments.  Wireless standards ensure interoperability and
   usability to those who design, deploy and manage wireless networks.

   The standards used in the vast majority of Alternative Networks come
   from the IEEE Standard Association's IEEE 802 Working Group.
   Standards developed by other international entities can also be used,
   as e.g. the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI).


5.2.1.1.  802.11 (Wi-Fi)

   The standard we are most interested in is 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, as it
   defines the protocol for Wireless LAN.  It is also known as "Wi-Fi".
   The original release (a/b) was issued in 1999 and allowed for rates
   up to 54 Mbit/s.  The latest release (802.11ac) approved in 2013
   reaches up to 866.7 Mbit/s.  In 2012, the IEEE issued the 802.11-2012
   Standard that consolidates all the previous amendments.  The document
   is freely downloadable from IEEE Standards [IEEE].

   The MAC protocol in 802.11 is called CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple
   Access with Collision Avoidance) and was designed for short
   distances; the transmitter expects the reception of an acknowledgment
   for each transmitted unicast packet; if a certain waiting time is
   exceeded, the packet is retransmitted.  This behavior makes necessary
   the adaptation of several MAC parameters when 802.11 is used in long
   links [Simo_b].  Even with this adaptation, distance has a
   significant negative impact on performance.  For this reason, many
   vendors implement alternative medium access techniques that are
   offered alongside the standard CSMA/CA in their outdoor 802.11
   products.  These alternative proprietary MAC protocols usually employ
   some type of TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access).  Low cost
   equipment using these techniques can offer high throughput at
   distances above 100 kilometers.


5.2.1.2.  GSM

   GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications), from ETSI, has also
   been used in Alternative Networks as a Layer 2 option, as explained
   in [Mexican], [Village], [Heimerl].



5.2.1.3.  Dynamic Spectrum

   Some Alternative Networks make use of TV White Spaces - a set of UHF
   and VHF television frequencies that can be utilized by secondary
   users in locations where they are unused by licensed primary users
   such as television broadcasters.  Equipment that makes use of TV
   White Spaces is required to detect the presence of existing unused TV
   channels by means of a spectrum database and/or spectrum sensing in
   order to ensure that no harmful interference is caused to primary
   users.  In order to smartly allocate interference-free channels to
   the devices, cognitive radios are used which are able to modify their
   frequency, power and modulation techniques to meet the strict
   operating conditions required for secondary users.

   The use of the term "White Spaces" is often used to describe "TV
   White Spaces" as the VHF and UHF television frequencies were the
   first to be exploited on a secondary use basis.  There are two
   dominant standards for TV white space communication: (i) the 802.11af
   standard [IEEE.802-11AF.2013] - an adaptation of the 802.11 standard
   for TV white space bands and (ii) the IEEE 802.22 standard
   [IEEE.802-22.2011] for long-range rural communication.


5.2.1.3.1.  802.11af

   802.11af [IEEE.802-11AF.2013] is a modified version of the 802.11
   standard operating in TV White Space bands using Cognitive Radios to
   avoid interference with primary users.  The standard is often
   referred to as White-Fi or "Super Wi-Fi" and was approved in February
   2014. 802.11af contains much of the advances of all the 802.11
   standards including recent advances in 802.11ac such as up to four
   bonded channels, four spatial streams and very high rate 256-QAM
   modulation but with improved in-building penetration and outdoor
   coverage.  The maximum data rate achievable is 426.7 Mbps for
   countries with 6/7 MHz channels and 568.9 Mbps for countries with 8
   MHz channels.  Coverage is typically limited to 1km although longer
   range at lower throughput and using high gain antennas will be
   possible.

   Devices are designated as enabling stations (Access Points) or
   dependent stations (clients).  Enabling stations are authorized to
   control the operation of a dependent station and securely access a
   geolocation database.  Once the enabling station has received a list
   of available white space channels it can announce a chosen channel to
   the dependent stations for them to communicate with the enabling
   station. 802.11af also makes use of a registered location server - a
   local database that organizes the geographic location and operating
   parameters of all enabling stations.


5.2.1.3.2.  802.22

   802.22 [IEEE.802-22.2011] is a standard developed specifically for
   long range rural communications in TV white space frequencies and
   first approved in July 2011.  The standard is similar to the 802.16
   (WiMax) [IEEE.802-16.2008] standard with an added cognitive radio
   ability.  The maximum throughput of 802.22 is 22.6 Mbps for a single
   8 MHz channel using 64-QAM modulation.  The achievable range using
   the default MAC scheme is 30 km, however 100 km is possible with
   special scheduling techniques.  The MAC of 802.22 is specifically
   customized for long distances - for example, slots in a frame
   destined for more distant Consumer Premises Equipment (CPEs) are sent
   before slots destined for nearby CPEs.

   Base stations are required to have a Global Positioning System (GPS)
   and a connection to the Internet in order to query a geolocation
   spectrum database.  Once the base station receives the allowed TV
   channels, it communicates a preferred operating white space TV
   channel with the CPE devices.  The standard also includes a co-
   existence mechanism that uses beacons to make other 802.22 base
   stations aware of the presence of a base station that is not part of
   the same network.


6.  Upper layers

6.1.  Layer 3

6.1.1.  IP addressing

   Most known Alternative Networks started in or around the year 2000.
   IPv6 was fully specified by then, but almost all Alternative Networks
   still use IPv4.  A survey [Avonts] indicated that IPv6 rollout
   presents a challenge to Community Networks.

   Most Community Networks use private IPv4 address ranges, as defined
   by [RFC1918].  The motivation for this was the lower cost and the
   simplified IP allocation because of the large available address
   ranges.


6.1.2.  Routing protocols

   As stated in previous sections, Alternative Networks are composed of
   possibly different layer 2 devices, resulting in a mesh of nodes.
   Connection between different nodes is not guaranteed and the link
   stability can vary strongly over time.  To tackle this, some
   Alternative Networks use mesh network routing protocols while other
   networks use more traditional routing protocols.  Some networks
   operate multiple routing protocols in parallel.  For example, they
   use a mesh protocol inside different islands and use traditional
   routing protocols to connect these islands.

6.1.2.1.  Traditional routing protocols

   The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), as defined by [RFC4271] is used by
   a number of Community Networks, because of its well-studied behavior
   and scalability.

   For similar reasons, smaller networks opt to run the Open Shortest
   Path First (OSPF) protocol, as defined by [RFC2328].


6.1.2.2.  Mesh routing protocols

   A large number of Alternative Networks use the Optimized Link State
   Routing Protocol (OLSR) as defined in [RFC3626].  The pro-active link
   state routing protocol is a good match with Alternative Networks
   because it has good performance in mesh networks where nodes have
   multiple interfaces.

   The Better Approach To Mobile Adhoc Networking (BATMAN) [Abolhasan]
   protocol was developed by members of the Freifunk community.  The
   protocol handles all routing at layer 2, creating one bridged
   network.

   Parallel to BGP, some networks also run the BatMan-eXperimental
   (BMX6) protocol [Neumann].  This is an advanced version of the BATMAN
   protocol which is based on IPv6 and tries to exploit the social
   structure of Alternative Networks.


6.2.  Transport layer

6.2.1.  Traffic Management when sharing network resources

   When network resources are shared (as e.g. in the networks explained
   in Section 4.4), special care has to be taken with the management of
   the traffic at upper layers.  From a crowdshared perspective, and
   considering just regular TCP connections during the critical sharing
   time, the Access Point offering the service is likely to be the
   bottleneck of the connection.  This is the main concern of sharers,
   having several implications.  There should be an adequate Active
   Queue Management (AQM) mechanism that implements a Lower-than-best-
   effort (LBE) [RFC6297] policy for the user and protects the sharer.
   Achieving LBE behavior requires the appropriate tuning of the well
   known mechanisms such as Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)
   [RFC3168], or Random Early Detection (RED) [RFC2309], or other more
   recent AQM mechanisms such as Controlled Delay (CoDel) and
   [I-D.ietf-aqm-codel] PIE (Proportional Integral controller Enhanced)
   [I-D.ietf-aqm-pie] that aid low latency.


6.3.  Services provided

   This section provides an overview of the services between hosts
   inside the network.  They can be divided into Intranet services,
   connecting hosts between them, and Internet services, connecting to
   nodes outside the network.


6.3.1.  Intranet services

   Intranet services can include, but are not limited to:

   - VoIP (e.g. with SIP).

   - Remote desktop (e.g. using my home computer and my Internet
   connection when I am away).

   - FTP file sharing (e.g. distribution of software).

# and media
[JS] Ok.

   - P2P file sharing.

   - Public video cameras.

   - DNS.

   - Online games servers.

   - Jabber instant messaging.

   - IRC chat.

   - Weather stations.

   - NTP.

   - Network monitoring.

   - Videoconferencing / streaming.

   - Radio streaming.


# Message / Bulletin board
[JS] Ok



6.3.2.  Access to the Internet


6.3.2.1.  Web browsing proxies

   A number of federated proxies may provide web browsing service for
   the users.  Other services (file sharing, VoIP, etc.) are not usually
   allowed in many Alternative Networks due to bandwidth limitations.


6.3.2.2.  Use of VPNs

   Some "micro-ISPs" may use the network as a backhaul for providing
   Internet access, setting up VPNs from the client to a machine with
   Internet access.

As Javier says, we have discussed this possibility in the GAIA
meeting in Prague
(<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/93/minutes/minutes-93-gaia">https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/93/minutes/minutes-93-gaia</a>):

"Lixia Zhang: The Internet didn’t start as a community effort. On
the draft, what is the main purpose? I’m interested in what you
have learned, and what advice you may have.

Niels ten Oever: This is a great overview, but how will you set
boundaries. There are lots of handbook materials that could be
linked to, to avoid making this draft grow to 100s of pages. In
particular we could define more on centralised v. decentralised
approaches.

Jane Coffin: Energy is also important for rural areas.

Mat: I think the original motivation was to get a definition of
“Alternative Networks”, it’s not scoped to be 100s of pages, but
more can we define what we mean as Alternative Networks, and then
provide examples. Lixia’s suggestion of looking at learning
outcomes, could be a future document that may be useful."


We also talked about that in the list, and we (more or less)
agreed on this solution: to first focus on a "taxonomy" draft, and
leave "deployment experiences" for future work.
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/gaia/current/msg00831.html">http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/gaia/current/msg00831.html</a>

In fact, we already removed some content from the draft, as it was
related to "deployment experiences". See parts removed from Section
4 in these two versions:
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://www.ietf.org/rfcdiff?url1=draft-irtf-gaia-alternative-network">https://www.ietf.org/rfcdiff?url1=draft-irtf-gaia-alternative-network</a>-

So my opinion is that we should avoid including this in the
present document. As you said in Prague, it is a matter of defining
some boundaries on the scope of the document. What do you think?

</pre>
        </blockquote>
        <pre wrap="">
I would leave that for the authors and the group to decide. But AFAIK
there are a few major deployments / projects out there, such as
Freifunk (Germany), Guifi (Catalunia), Rhizomatica (Mexico), and
perhaps Commotion (Tunisia, Redhook, Congo). Referencing these could
bring the draft closer to actual practices (and with that increase
relevance). Another approach could be providing a concrete example for
every topology you define under 4.

I completely agree with you that deployment experiences should not go
into this draft, that would be too much. The same is true for
providing an exhaustive list of implementations.

For the most important points (the most detailed ones), there are
a few good interdisciplinary people in this lists with a
background in development studies. I guess that it is just a
matter of these people polishing the text.

For point 4, ... well, the decission after Prague was to TAKE
OUT the experiences and build another document. If experiences
are required in here, then, we should reverse that decission and
pilot a controlled introduction of best practices / case studies
in the appropriate subsections.

0. The topic of the draft is very relevant and timely and
brings together many different angles that are needed to
address the multidisciplinary nature of access, the
Internet, and community owned

1. The issue of the digital divide is approached from a
'development studies' paradigm (e.g. developing
countries), quite some scientific literature has been
published about this topic. Most current literature
acknowledges that for instance term 'developing country' is
problematic because it assumes that all countries are on a
similar trajectory, from 'underdeveloped' to 'western'.
Empirical data shows that this is not the case. More
accurate would be to address differential developmental
trajectories by referring to the Global North vs. the
Global South, or using other frames.

Also terms like 'Digital Divide', 'Data Revolution',
'Information Society' as well as the 'WSIS process' have
been dissected, discussed and interpreted in quite a
variety of ways. it might be good to engage with the
literature on this if you would like to use these terms,
and if so, refer to the relevant sources.

Same is true for the method or model of knowledge transfer
that is mentioned in the draft. At several places it is
implied that knowledge travels from North to South and
from Urban to Rural, which might be a one dimensional way
of representing a quite multifaceted process of technology
appropriation and development.

In terms of methodology: you are clearly coming at this
problem from a multidisciplinary approach. Which is great,
considering the multidisciplinary nature of the Internet
and the problem you are addressing. However, if you do
decide to use concepts from different fields and
disciplines (like for instance urban and rural from urban
planning, demand and provision from economics or the
digital divide from sociology) it is important to make this
explicit. I would suggest adding a sub-section in which you
explain how you built your multidisciplinary research
method and why you use the concepts you applied.

2. There is a lot of doubling between abstract and
introduction. I recommend reducing the abstract.

3. The discussion under point 1. and 2. is maybe not
necessary for achieving the goal of providing a a taxonomy
of alternative network deployments. However, Maybe the
first part could be shorter.

4. It could perhaps be interesting to provide some
additional information on actual alternative network
deployments, perhaps by providing some case studies and,
on the basis of these, a set of best practices /
recommendations for specific situations.

In the attached file more inline editorial comments and
suggestions are provided.

Best,

Niels

1) Few typos:

   typically limited to 1km => typically limited to 1 km 

   Free Network, included in Section 2 . => Free Network, included in
   Section 2.

   There is an shared platform => There is a shared platform

2) Some suggestions:

Current version:
   As stated in previous sections, Alternative Networks are composed of
   possibly different layer 2 devices, resulting in a mesh of nodes.
   Connection between different nodes is not guaranteed and the link
   stability can vary strongly over time.  To tackle this, some
   Alternative Networks use mesh network routing protocols while other
   networks use more traditional routing protocols.  Some networks
   operate multiple routing protocols in parallel.  For example, they
   use a mesh protocol inside different islands and use traditional
   routing protocols to connect these islands.

Opinion:
   While nowadays most alternative networks rely on unlicensed spectrum
   and WiFi, 3GPP technologies are also used and, IMHO, may play an
   important role in future. As you know, companies such as [Endaga]
   and [Range] are offering GSM solutions, and there are solid
   initiatives towards LTE / 4G [IEEE-SDR]. In this context, I think
   the assumption in the above paragraph that alternative networks
   necessarily use mesh should be avoided.

   Own 4G Networks, IEEE Spectrum 2015. Available at 
   http://spectrum.ieee.org/telecom/wireless/softwaredefined-radio-will-let-communities-build-their-own-4g-networks


Current version:
   The standards used in the vast majority of Alternative Networks come
   from the IEEE Standard Association's IEEE 802 Working Group.
   Standards developed by other international entities can also be used,
   as e.g. the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI).

Suggestion:
   The standards used in the vast majority of Alternative Networks come
   from the IEEE Standard Association's IEEE 802 Working Group.
   Standards developed by other international entities are also used,
   as e.g. the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI)
   and 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).


Current version:
   GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications), from ETSI, has also
   been used in Alternative Networks as a Layer 2 option, as explained
   in [Mexican], [Village], [Heimerl].

Opinion:
   Item 6.2.1.2 could be expanded to include other 3GPP technologies,
   such as 3G, 4G/LTE [IEEE-SDR] and 5G [OpenAir], mentioning systems
   such as [OpenBTS], [OpenBSC] and [YateBTS]. If this is reasonable, 
   I could try to expand it.

Current version:
   5.  Classification of Alternative Networks
     5.1.  Community Networks
     5.2.  Wireless Internet Service Providers, WISPs
     5.3.  Shared infrastructure model
     5.4.  Crowdshared approaches, led by the users and third party
           stakeholders
     5.5.  Testbeds for research purposes

Opinion:
   At least in academia, I think it is hard to avoid using the term 
   "Community Network" when describing a "Shared infrastructure model",
   for example, due to the importance and usage of "community". A
   search for "community networks" at IEEE Xplore returns 220 items.
   IMHO, this term could then be avoided as a specific
   classification to allow its general use, as a group of alternative
   networks. It seems more appropriate something like:
   5.  Classification of Alternative Networks
     5.1.  Large Scale Free and Open Community Networks
     5.2.  Wireless Internet Service Providers, WISPs
     5.3.  Shared Infrastructure
     5.4.  Crowdshared
     5.5.  Testbeds for research purposes
   And 5.3 could be eventually called "Shared Radio Access and/or
   Backhaul Infrastructure".

Hello,

I have recently joined the GAIA group and found
draft-irtf-gaia-alternative-network-deployments-03.txt very
interesting. I am not sure if this is the proper way of contributing,
but I am sending attached some suggestions.

PS: Our university (UFPA) has partnership with Brazilian
institutions to provide telephony services and Internet via GPRS to
underserved (and very poor) communities in the Amazon forest. We are
then biased towards using GSM due e.g. to the low cost of the handsets.

Regards,
Aldebaro

Dear Niels,

First of all, thank you very much for your detailed review. As said
today, your comments will be useful for building an improved version.
=20
=20
My pleasure!
=20
=20
But I think here is something we should decide now: what to do
about "deployment experiences", i.e. point 4 of your review.
=20
4. It could perhaps be interesting to provide some
additional information on actual alternative network
deployments, perhaps by providing some case studies and,
on the basis of these, a set of best practices /
recommendations for specific situations.
=20
As Javier says, we have discussed this possibility in the GAIA
meeting in Prague
(https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/93/minutes/minutes-93-gaia):
=20
"Lixia Zhang: The Internet didn=92t start as a community effort. On
the draft, what is the main purpose? I=92m interested in what you
have learned, and what advice you may have.
=20
Niels ten Oever: This is a great overview, but how will you set
boundaries. There are lots of handbook materials that could be
linked to, to avoid making this draft grow to 100s of pages. In
particular we could define more on centralised v. decentralised
approaches.
=20
Jane Coffin: Energy is also important for rural areas.
=20
Mat: I think the original motivation was to get a definition of
=93Alternative Networks=94, it=92s not scoped to be 100s of pages, but
more can we define what we mean as Alternative Networks, and then
provide examples. Lixia=92s suggestion of looking at learning
outcomes, could be a future document that may be useful."
=20
=20
We also talked about that in the list, and we (more or less)
agreed on this solution: to first focus on a "taxonomy" draft, and
leave "deployment experiences" for future work.
http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/gaia/current/msg00831.html
=20
In fact, we already removed some content from the draft, as it was
related to "deployment experiences". See parts removed from Section
4 in these two versions:
https://www.ietf.org/rfcdiff?url1=3Ddraft-irtf-gaia-alternative-network-
deployments-01&url2=3Ddraft-irtf-gaia-alternative-network-deployments-00
=20
=20
=20
And we have also asked for volunteers for the "deployment
experiences" draft:
http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/gaia/current/msg00916.html
=20
=20
So my opinion is that we should avoid including this in the
present document. As you said in Prague, it is a matter of defining
some boundaries on the scope of the document. What do you think?
=20
=20
I would leave that for the authors and the group to decide. But AFAIK
there are a few major deployments / projects out there, such as
Freifunk (Germany), Guifi (Catalunia), Rhizomatica (Mexico), and
perhaps Commotion (Tunisia, Redhook, Congo). Referencing these could
bring the draft closer to actual practices (and with that increase
relevance). Another approach could be providing a concrete example for
every topology you define under 4.
=20
I completely agree with you that deployment experiences should not go
into this draft, that would be too much. The same is true for
providing an exhaustive list of implementations.
=20
Thanks in advance,
=20
Hope this helps,

For the most important points (the most detailed ones), there are
a few good interdisciplinary people in this lists with a
background in development studies. I guess that it is just a
matter of these people polishing the text.
=20
For point 4, ... well, the decission after Prague was to TAKE
OUT the experiences and build another document. If experiences
are required in here, then, we should reverse that decission and
pilot a controlled introduction of best practices / case studies
in the appropriate subsections.

0. The topic of the draft is very relevant and timely and
brings together many different angles that are needed to
address the multidisciplinary nature of access, the
Internet, and community owned
networks.
=20
1. The issue of the digital divide is approached from a
'development studies' paradigm (e.g. developing
countries), quite some scientific literature has been
published about this topic. Most current literature
acknowledges that for instance term 'developing country' is
problematic because it assumes that all countries are on a
similar trajectory, from 'underdeveloped' to 'western'.
Empirical data shows that this is not the case. More
accurate would be to address differential developmental
trajectories by referring to the Global North vs. the
Global South, or using other frames.
=20
Also terms like 'Digital Divide', 'Data Revolution',
'Information Society' as well as the 'WSIS process' have
been dissected, discussed and interpreted in quite a
variety of ways. it might be good to engage with the
literature on this if you would like to use these terms,
and if so, refer to the relevant sources.
=20
Same is true for the method or model of knowledge transfer
that is mentioned in the draft. At several places it is
implied that knowledge travels from North to South and
from Urban to Rural, which might be a one dimensional way
of representing a quite multifaceted process of technology
appropriation and development.
=20
In terms of methodology: you are clearly coming at this
problem from a multidisciplinary approach. Which is great,
considering the multidisciplinary nature of the Internet
and the problem you are addressing. However, if you do
decide to use concepts from different fields and
disciplines (like for instance urban and rural from urban
planning, demand and provision from economics or the
digital divide from sociology) it is important to make this
explicit. I would suggest adding a sub-section in which you
explain how you built your multidisciplinary research
method and why you use the concepts you applied.
=20
2. There is a lot of doubling between abstract and
introduction. I recommend reducing the abstract.
=20
3. The discussion under point 1. and 2. is maybe not
necessary for achieving the goal of providing a a taxonomy
of alternative network deployments. However, Maybe the
first part could be shorter.
=20
4. It could perhaps be interesting to provide some
additional information on actual alternative network
deployments, perhaps by providing some case studies and,
on the basis of these, a set of best practices /
recommendations for specific situations.

ACM Information Centric Networking (ICN) 2016
CALL FOR PAPERS, POSTERS, AND DEMOS, WORKSHOPS (Deadline: March 30, 2016)
and TUTORIALS

http://conferences2.sigcomm.org/acm-icn/2016

Information Centric Networking (ICN) is a new networking paradigm intended
to provide access to information without requiring an explicit binding of
that information to a particular location. By directly addressing
information, ICN supports mobile users and mobile networked devices, offers
a higher-level communication service to applications, and promotes
authentication and efficiency in the transmission and dissemination of
information. Over the last few years, a global research and development
community has grown around the idea of ICN.

ICN 2016 is the third edition of the ACM Conference on Information-Centric
Networking, the premier international forum for researchers and
practitioners to present and discuss the most recent innovations, trends,
experiences, and challenges in information centric networking. ACM ICN 2016
will be a single-track conference featuring paper and poster presentations,
panel discussions, and demonstrations.  In addition to the "best  paper
award", ACM ICN 2016 will give this year a "best demo award" (based on
community judging by registered participants), as well as a "best dataset
award" (for poster submissions qualifying for this category).

The Technical Program Committee of ACM ICN 2016 invites high-quality
submissions describing unpublished research results in all aspects of ICN.
The third edition on ACM ICN will especially welcome work that reflects the
maturity of ICN field, under several angles, including for instance
interoperability, architectural comparison with quantitative assessment,
and critical reassessment of previous work with particular emphasis on
contributions to architectural designs and reproducible experimental
evaluations.

Topics of interest include:
- Application programming interfaces (APIs) for ICN and their evaluation
- Applications of ICN
- Architecture design and evaluation
- Caching
- Comparison of different ICN architecture designs
- Critical analysis of previous work in ICN
- Deployments of ICN
- Economics and business models
- Evaluation methodology and metrics
- Experience from implementation
- Feasibility studies of ICN for high speed networking
- ICN support for ad hoc, direct peer-to-peer communication
- Implementation strategies for ICN
- Interoperability across ICN architectures
- Management in ICN
- Opportunities for ICN in the developing world
- Privacy
- Routing in ICN
- Scalability analysis of ICN
- Tools, experimentation facilities, and measurement methodology for ICN
- Transport issues in ICN
- Trust management and access control


Submission instructions

Papers submitted for consideration must not have been already published
elsewhere and must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere
during the consideration period. Specifically, authors are required to
adhere to the ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism and the ACM Policy on
Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions.

ACM ICN 2016 invites two kind of submissions, namely Full-paper and
Short-paper submissions. All submissions must be in English and in PDF
format. Submissions that do not comply with these instructions will be
rejected without review. Papers must be submitted electronically through
the ICN 2016 submission site. Please refer to the detailed submission
instructions that are reported on the ACM ICN 2016 website.

Full-papers can be up to 10 pages in length following the ACM SIGCOMM
format, and should convey results of mature research. Short-papers can be
up to 6 pages in length and should report on cross-disciplinary work, or
less mature work not qualifying for a full submission. Papers with doctoral
students as first authors are particularly encouraged. Note: Submissions
exceeding the 6 pages length will be considered as full-papers.

Submissions will be reviewed and evaluated on the basis of originality,
importance of contribution, soundness, evaluation, quality of presentation
and appropriate comparison to related work. The program committee as a
whole will make final decisions about which submissions to accept for
presentation at the conference. A "best paper award" will be attributed
from the program committee to one among the accepted papers in each of the
Full paper and Short paper tracks.

The program committee may propose that authors either 1) revise papers of
special merit and resubmit them to an ICN'16 workshop for consideration, or
2) present their work with a poster accompanied by a 2-page extended
abstract. Please notice that ACM ICN 2016 also have a specific call for
proposals for workshops, demos, tutorials and panel sessions.

Important Dates
    Paper Registration Deadline (Long and Short): May 7, 2016 (hard
deadline)
    Paper Submission Deadline (Long and Short): May 15, 2016 (hard deadline)
    Acceptance Notification: July 7, 2016
    Camera Ready Due: August 15, 2016
    Conference dates: September 26-28, 2016


CALL FOR POSTERS, DEMOS, and DATASETS

The ICN poster and demo sessions are intended to showcase
works-in-progress. Topics of interest are the same as those listed in the
main track CFP. We strongly encourage both student and industry
submissions. Both demos and posters should be accompanied by a 2 page
extended abstract, which will be published in the conference proceedings.
Abstract for posters, demos and datasets can be submitted via the ICN 2016
submission website.

Preparation of Posters

You are not required to submit the poster initially. Instead, you should
submit a 2 page  extended abstract. If the abstract is accepted, you will
then be asked to prepare the poster. The abstract should clearly state: (a)
the problem being addressed, (b) what makes this problem interesting, (c)
your approach, and (d) the key contribution. Acceptance is based on a peer
review process of all abstracts.

A poster should be of size 32 inches x 42 inches (this is between A0 and
A1) in portrait mode. It should be visually appealing, portraying ideas
primarily via diagrams rather than text. The poster will be displayed on
easels. The organizers will supply the foam backing and a method to mount
the posters to the foam backing

In particular, we call for posters that include accompanying datasets
shared with the community. The aim is to collect and share datasets that
can hopefully become a common ground for evaluation in the ICN community.
Such posters will be eligible for a "best dataset award".

Preparation of Demos

You are required to submit a 2 page extended abstract, which describes the
demo. The extended abstract should clearly state: (a) the problem being
addressed and why it is important, (b) the approach taken and the design of
the demo, (c) the key contribution and (d) any special technical
requirements. If accepted, it is strongly recommended that a poster
supporting the demo is produced.

Acceptance is based on a peer review process of all abstracts. A "best demo
award" will be given this year, based on community judging by registered
participants

A demo should be self contained and ideally interactive. Accepted demos
will be given a table (6 feet by 30 inches), a power supply (100V TypeA)
and WiFi Internet access(NAT only) by default. Details regarding poster
preparation are described above.

Important Poster and Demo Dates
    Poster and Demo Submission Deadline: July 8, 2016
    Notification of Acceptance: July 29, 2016
    Camera Ready Due: August 15, 2016

CALL FOR TUTORIALS

Following last year's successful tutorials, ACM ICN 2016 solicits proposals
for half- or full-day tutorials on topics relevant to the ICN research that
can help the audience gain further understanding of this new and exciting
area.  In particular, we seek tutorials on intermediate and advanced topics
of critical importance to the maturing ICN field  (such as, but not limited
to, applied cryptography, or technological advances for ICN, or application
of ICN to specific fields such as IoT), offered through collaboration
between ICN researchers and experts in other domains.

Tutorials may be lectures, hands-on training, or any combination of the
above. Exploring diverse ways of interacting with the audience is welcome,
as are cross-disciplinary topics. Tutorial proposals should be submitted in
PDF format, not exceeding three (3) pages in total, and be sent to the
workshop/tutorial chairs.

Each proposal must include:

- A motivation for the tutorial (why this, why at ICN 2016?)
- Detailed biographies of the trainers.
- An outline of the tutorial content.
- The type of tutorial (e.g., lecture vs. hands-on)
- References to previous iterations of the tutorial (if applicable)
including their date, venue, topics and number of participants and the
motivation for the new proposal.
- Requirements for the tutorial room.
- Requirements for the attendants (e.g., must bring own laptop, familiarity

ICN has both broad application and draws from many related technical
fields.  Recognizing this, ICN 2016 may hold one or two workshops in
conjunction with the main conference, tentatively on 26th September 2016,
intended to act as bridges between the ICN community and researchers in
related fields such as mobility, security, caching, applications, ICT4D,
etc.  We encourage workshop proposals co-chaired by members of the ICN
community and these other fields.  Workshop proposals should be submitted
in PDF format,  and be sent to the Tutorial/Workshop chairs.

A workshop proposal should contain at least the following information:

- Motivation and rationale for the workshop.
- A  draft Call For Papers (CFP), as complete as possible.
-The workshop deadlines, both internal and external. See below for
guidelines on important external guidelines.
- Names and affiliations of main organizers. Include a tentative
composition of the committees (as complete as possible). Please indicate
whether prospective TPC members have been contacted, and whether they have
accepted the invitation. - We strongly discourage speculative TPC listings.
- Workshop format, i.e., expected number of presented papers, invited
talks, panels, demonstrations, etc. Also, whether you expect to be full day
or half day workshop.
- Expected number of participants. Further, if the workshop is not a
teaching workshop, please include the expected number of submissions.
- Prior history of this workshop, if any, including number of submissions,
number of accepted papers, and attendee count. If the workshop was

Hi Jose,

Thanks a lot for this. I think the docoment really improved. The
examples at the end of the topologies make everything more concrete and
add relevance to the document.

I still have a few (small) issues with:

1.
The first sentence of the abstract is quite complex. Can you rephrase? I
think the abstract covers the content really well though, so this is
only textual.

2.
Add a reference to GAIA charter (source of the quote I presume) in the
introduction.

3.
1.1, 2nd bullet, 's are used' can be removed

4.
I still have issues with the lemma on Developed and developing countries
in the way it is used now. I think the easiest way to resolve this is to
use the terms 'Global north' and 'global south'.

I also advise to remove a reference to 'the folk way of living' and 'the
modern technology-driven way of living which began in the Industrial
Revolution'. Because: a) it implies a false linearity. 'The modern
technology driven-way of living' is not the only way to progress. b) it
creates two false unities, not all ways of living (and uses of
technology) are the same in the global south nor the global north. There
is a multitude of uses and appropriations of technology.

5.
Chapter 3. Scenarios where Alternative Networks are deployed
Replace 'in' in first sentence with 'on'

6.
When you talk about WSIS, it might be good to talk about it in the past
tense. AFAIK the new workplan after WSIS+10 evaluation has not been
finalized, but I might be wrong.
If the workplan has been finalized it might be good to reference to that.=


Hope this helps.

Best,

Niels

El 2016-03-15 16:25, Niels ten Oever escribi=C3=B3:<br>
&gt; Hi Jose,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Thanks a lot for this. I think the docoment really improved. The<br>
&gt; examples at the end of the topologies make everything more concrete an=
d<br>
&gt; add relevance to the document.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I still have a few (small) issues with:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; 1.<br>
&gt; The first sentence of the abstract is quite complex. Can you rephrase?=
<br>
&gt; I<br>
&gt; think the abstract covers the content really well though, so this is<b=
r>
&gt; only textual.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; 2.<br>
&gt; Add a reference to GAIA charter (source of the quote I presume) in the=
<br>
&gt; introduction.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; 3.<br>
&gt; 1.1, 2nd bullet, &#39;s are used&#39; can be removed<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; 4.<br>
&gt; I still have issues with the lemma on Developed and developing<br>
&gt; countries<br>
&gt; in the way it is used now. I think the easiest way to resolve this is<=
br>
&gt; to<br>
&gt; use the terms &#39;Global north&#39; and &#39;global south&#39;.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I also advise to remove a reference to &#39;the folk way of living&#39=
; and<br>
&gt; &#39;the<br>
&gt; modern technology-driven way of living which began in the Industrial<b=
r>
&gt; Revolution&#39;. Because: a) it implies a false linearity. &#39;The mo=
dern<br>
&gt; technology driven-way of living&#39; is not the only way to progress. =
b) it<br>
&gt; creates two false unities, not all ways of living (and uses of<br>
&gt; technology) are the same in the global south nor the global north.<br>
&gt; There<br>
&gt; is a multitude of uses and appropriations of technology.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; 5.<br>
&gt; Chapter 3. Scenarios where Alternative Networks are deployed<br>
&gt; Replace &#39;in&#39; in first sentence with &#39;on&#39;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; 6.<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Dear Niels,<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; First of all, thank you very much for your detailed re=
view. As said<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; today, your comments will be useful for building an im=
proved<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; version.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; My pleasure!<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But I think here is something we should decide now: wh=
at to do<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; about &quot;deployment experiences&quot;, i.e. point 4=
 of your review.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 4. It could perhaps be interesting to =
provide some<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; additional information on actual alter=
native network<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; deployments, perhaps by providing some=
 case studies and,<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on the basis of these, a set of best p=
ractices /<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; recommendations for specific situation=
s.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As Javier says, we have discussed this possibility in =
the GAIA<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; meeting in Prague<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (<a href=3D"https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/93/minute=

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Lixia Zhang: The Internet didn=E2=80=99t start a=
s a community effort. On<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the draft, what is the main purpose? I=E2=80=99m inter=
ested in what you<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have learned, and what advice you may have.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Niels ten Oever: This is a great overview, but how wil=
l you set<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; boundaries. There are lots of handbook materials that =
could be<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; linked to, to avoid making this draft grow to 100s of =
pages. In<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; particular we could define more on centralised v. dece=
ntralised<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; approaches.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Jane Coffin: Energy is also important for rural areas.=
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Mat: I think the original motivation was to get a defi=
nition of<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; =E2=80=9CAlternative Networks=E2=80=9D, it=E2=80=99s n=
ot scoped to be 100s of pages, but<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; more can we define what we mean as Alternative Network=
s, and then<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; provide examples. Lixia=E2=80=99s suggestion of lookin=
g at learning<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; outcomes, could be a future document that may be usefu=
l.&quot;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We also talked about that in the list, and we (more or=
 less)<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; agreed on this solution: to first focus on a &quot;tax=
onomy&quot; draft, and<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; leave &quot;deployment experiences&quot; for future wo=
rk.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <a href=3D"http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/gaia/c=
urrent/msg00831.html" rel=3D"noreferrer" target=3D"_blank">http://www.ietf.=
org/mail-archive/web/gaia/current/msg00831.html</a><br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In fact, we already removed some content from the draf=
t, as it was<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; related to &quot;deployment experiences&quot;. See par=
ts removed from Section<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 4 in these two versions:<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <a href=3D"https://www.ietf.org/rfcdiff?url1=3Ddraft-i=
rtf-gaia-alternative-network-" rel=3D"noreferrer" target=3D"_blank">https:/=

oyments-00<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; And we have also asked for volunteers for the &quot;deployment<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; experiences&quot; draft:<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <a href=3D"http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/gaia/c=

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So my opinion is that we should avoid including this i=
n the<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; present document. As you said in Prague, it is a matte=
r of defining<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; some boundaries on the scope of the document. What do =
you think?<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; I would leave that for the authors and the group to decide. But AF=
AIK<br>
&gt;&gt; there are a few major deployments / projects out there, such as<br=
>
&gt;&gt; Freifunk (Germany), Guifi (Catalunia), Rhizomatica (Mexico), and<b=
r>
&gt;&gt; perhaps Commotion (Tunisia, Redhook, Congo). Referencing these cou=
ld<br>
&gt;&gt; bring the draft closer to actual practices (and with that increase=
<br>
&gt;&gt; relevance). Another approach could be providing a concrete example=
 for<br>
&gt;&gt; every topology you define under 4.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; I completely agree with you that deployment experiences should not=
 go<br>
&gt;&gt; into this draft, that would be too much. The same is true for<br>
&gt;&gt; providing an exhaustive list of implementations.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks in advance,<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Hope this helps,<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; For the most important points (the most detailed o=

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a few good interdisciplinary people in this lists =

 is just a<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; matter of these people polishing the text.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; For point 4, ... well, the decission after Prague =
was to TAKE<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; OUT the experiences and build another document. If=
 experiences<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are required in here, then, we should reverse that=

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 0. The topic of the draft is very rele=
vant and timely and<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; brings together many different angles =
that are needed to<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; address the multidisciplinary nature o=
f access, the<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Internet, and community owned<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; networks.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. The issue of the digital divide is =
approached from a<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;development studies&#39; paradigm=
 (e.g. developing<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; countries), quite some scientific lite=
rature has been<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; published about this topic. Most curre=
nt literature<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; acknowledges that for instance term &#=
39;developing country&#39; is<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; problematic because it assumes that al=
l countries are on a<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; similar trajectory, from &#39;underdev=
eloped&#39; to &#39;western&#39;.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Empirical data shows that this is not =
the case. More<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; accurate would be to address different=
ial developmental<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; trajectories by referring to the Globa=
l North vs. the<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Global South, or using other frames.<b=
r>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Also terms like &#39;Digital Divide&#3=
9;, &#39;Data Revolution&#39;,<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;Information Society&#39; as well =
as the &#39;WSIS process&#39; have<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; been dissected, discussed and interpre=
ted in quite a<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; variety of ways. it might be good to e=
ngage with the<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; literature on this if you would like t=
o use these terms,<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and if so, refer to the relevant sourc=
es.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Same is true for the method or model o=
f knowledge transfer<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that is mentioned in the draft. At sev=
eral places it is<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; implied that knowledge travels from No=
rth to South and<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from Urban to Rural, which might be a =
one dimensional way<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of representing a quite multifaceted p=
rocess of technology<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; appropriation and development.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In terms of methodology: you are clear=
ly coming at this<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; problem from a multidisciplinary appro=
ach. Which is great,<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; considering the multidisciplinary natu=
re of the Internet<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and the problem you are addressing. Ho=
wever, if you do<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; decide to use concepts from different =
fields and<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; disciplines (like for instance urban a=
nd rural from urban<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; planning, demand and provision from ec=
onomics or the<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; digital divide from sociology) it is i=
mportant to make this<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; explicit. I would suggest adding a sub=
-section in which you<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; explain how you built your multidiscip=
linary research<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; method and why you use the concepts yo=
u applied.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. There is a lot of doubling between =
abstract and<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; introduction. I recommend reducing the=
 abstract.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 3. The discussion under point 1. and 2=
. is maybe not<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; necessary for achieving the goal of pr=
oviding a a taxonomy<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of alternative network deployments. Ho=
wever, Maybe the<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; first part could be shorter.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 4. It could perhaps be interesting to =
provide some<br>

Hello Niels.

I have added new versions of the sentences inline, starting with [JS].

[JS]    This document presents a taxonomy of a set of "Alternative 
Network
         Deployments" emerged in the last decade with the aim of bringing
         Internet connectivity to people. They employ architectures and
         topologies different from those of mainstream networks, and rely
         on alternative business models.

[JS] added:
    [GAIA]     Internet Research Task Force, IRTF., "Charter: Global
               Access to the Internet for All Research Group GAIA",
               available at https://irtf.org/gaia , 2016.

[JS] New versions of different paragraphs:

[JS] In section 2:

    o  "Global north" and "global south": Although there is no consensus
       on the terms to be used when talking about the different
       development level of countries, we will employ the term "global
       south" to refer to nations with a relatively lower standard of
       living.  This distinction is normally intended to reflect basic
       economic country conditions.  In common practice, Japan in Asia,
       Canada and the United States in northern America, Australia and
       New Zealand in Oceania, and Europe are considered "developed"
       regions or areas [UN], so we will employ the term "global north"
       when talking about them.

[JS] In section 3:
    Different studies have reported that as much as 60% of the people in
    the planet do not have Internet connectivity [Sprague],
    [InternetStats].  In addition, those unconnected are unevenly
    distributed: only 31 percent of the population in "global south"
    countries had access in 2014, against 80 percent in "global north"
    countries [WorldBank2016].  This is one of the reasons behind the
    inclusion of the objective of providing "significantly increase
    access to ICT and strive to provide universal and affordable access
    to internet in LDCs by 2020," as one of the targets in the
    Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [SDG], considered as a part of
    "Goal 9.  Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and
    sustainable industrialization and foster innovation."

    For the purpose of this document, a distinction between "global
    north" and "global south" zones is made, highlighting the factors
    related to ICT (Information and Communication Technologies), which
    can be quantified in terms of:

    (...)

    Some Alternative Networks have been deployed in underserved areas,
    where citizens may be compelled to take a more active part in the
    design and implementation of ICT solutions.  However, Alternative
    Networks are also present in some "global north" countries, being
    built as an alternative to commercial ones managed by mainstream
    network operators.


[JS] 3.1.  Urban vs. Rural Areas

    The differences presented in the previous section are not only
    present between countries, but within them too.  This is especially
    the case for rural inhabitants, who represent approximately 55% of
    the world's population [IFAD2011], 78% of them in "global south"
    countries [ITU2011].  According to the World Bank, adoption gaps
    "between rural and urban populations are falling for mobile phones
    but increasing for the internet" [WorldBank2016].


[JS] 4.5.  Typical scenarios

    The scenarios where Alternative Networks are usually deployed can be
    classified as:

    o  Urban / Rural areas.

    o  "Global north" / "Global south" countries.


[JS] 5.3.  Shared infrastructure model

    +----------------+--------------------------------------------------+

[JS] 6.1.  Wired

    In many ("global north" or "global south") countries it may happen
    that national service providers decline to provide connectivity to
    tiny and isolated villages.  So in some cases the villagers have
    created their own optical fiber networks.  This is the case in
    Lowenstedt in Germany [Lowenstedt], or some parts of Guifi.net
    [Cerda-Alabern].

[JS] This is the new version:

    In this context, the World Summit of the Information Society aimed at
    achieving "a people-centred, inclusive and development-oriented
    Information Society, where everyone can create, access, utilize and
    share information and knowledge.  Therefore, enabling individuals,
    communities and people to achieve their full potential in promoting
    their sustainable development and improving their quality of life".
    It also called upon "governments, private sector, civil society and
    international organizations" to actively engage to work towards the
    bridging of the digital divide [WSIS].

[JS]: However, it seems that WSIS is still alive: 
https://www.itu.int/net4/wsis/forum/2016/

[JS] I have also corrected some typos, as suggested by 
http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/gaia/current/msg01102.html

[JS] I have also added a "may" in this paragraph:

7.1.2.  Routing protocols

    As stated in previous sections, Alternative Networks are composed of
    possibly different layer 2 devices, resulting in a mesh of nodes.
    Connection between different nodes is not guaranteed and the link
    stability can vary strongly over time.  To tackle this, some
    Alternative Networks use mesh network routing protocols while other
    networks use more traditional routing protocols.  Some networks
    operate multiple routing protocols in parallel.  For example, they
    *may* use a mesh protocol inside different islands and rely on
    traditional routing protocols to connect these islands.


I attach the new version. I will upload it to the IETF web as soon as 
you are ok with these changes.

Thanks again,

Jose

Abstract:
   This document presents a taxonomy of a set of "Alternative Network
   Deployments" emerged in the last decade with the aim of bringing
   Internet connectivity to people.  They employ architectures and
   topologies different from those of mainstream networks, and rely on
   alternative business models.

   The document also surveys the technologies deployed in these
   networks, and their differing architectural characteristics,
   including a set of definitions and shared properties.

   The classification considers models such as Community Networks,
   Wireless Internet Service Providers (WISPs), networks owned by
   individuals but leased out to network operators who use them as a
   low-cost medium to reach the underserved population, and networks
   that provide connectivity by sharing wireless resources of the users.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I still have issues with the lemma on Developed and deve=
loping<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; countries in the way it is used now. I think the easiest=
 way to<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; resolve this is to use the terms &#39;Global north&#39; =
and &#39;global south&#39;.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I also advise to remove a reference to &#39;the folk way=
 of living&#39; and<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &#39;the modern technology-driven way of living which be=
gan in the<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Industrial Revolution&#39;. Because: a) it implies a fal=
se linearity.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &#39;The modern technology driven-way of living&#39; is =
not the only way to<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; progress. b) it creates two false unities, not all ways =
of living<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; (and uses of<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; technology) are the same in the global south nor the glo=
bal north.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; There is a multitude of uses and appropriations of techn=

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Hi Jose,<br>

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Dear Niels,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; First of all, thank you very much for yo=
ur detailed review. As<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; said today, your comments will be useful=
 for building an improved<br>
&gt; &gt; version.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; My pleasure!<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But I think here is something we should =
decide now: what to do<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; about &quot;deployment experiences&quot;=
, i.e. point 4 of your review.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 4. It could perhaps be i=
nteresting to provide some additional<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; information on actual al=
ternative network deployments,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; perhaps by providing som=
e case studies and, on the basis of<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; these, a set of best pra=
ctices / recommendations for specific<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; situations.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As Javier says, we have discussed this p=
ossibility in the GAIA<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; meeting in Prague<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (<a href=3D"https://www.ietf.org/proceed=
ings/93/minutes/minutes-93-gaia" rel=3D"noreferrer" target=3D"_blank">https=

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Lixia Zhang: The Internet didn=E2=
=80=99t start as a community effort. On<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the draft, what is the main purpose? I=
=E2=80=99m interested in what you<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have learned, and what advice you may ha=
ve.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Niels ten Oever: This is a great overvie=
w, but how will you set<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; boundaries. There are lots of handbook m=
aterials that could be<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; linked to, to avoid making this draft gr=
ow to 100s of pages. In<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; particular we could define more on centr=
alised v. decentralised<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; approaches.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Jane Coffin: Energy is also important fo=
r rural areas.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Mat: I think the original motivation was=
 to get a definition of<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; =E2=80=9CAlternative Networks=E2=80=9D, =
it=E2=80=99s not scoped to be 100s of pages, but<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; more can we define what we mean as Alter=
native Networks, and<br>
&gt; &gt; then<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; provide examples. Lixia=E2=80=99s sugges=
tion of looking at learning<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; outcomes, could be a future document tha=
t may be useful.&quot;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We also talked about that in the list, a=
nd we (more or less)<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; agreed on this solution: to first focus =
on a &quot;taxonomy&quot; draft,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and leave &quot;deployment experiences&q=
uot; for future work.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <a href=3D"http://www.ietf.org/mail-arch=

tp://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/gaia/current/msg00831.html</a><br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In fact, we already removed some content=
 from the draft, as it<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was related to &quot;deployment experien=
ces&quot;. See parts removed from<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Section<br>

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; And we have also asked for volunteers for the &quot;=
deployment<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; experiences&quot; draft:<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <a href=3D"http://www.ietf.org/mail-arch=

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So my opinion is that we should avoid in=
cluding this in the<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; present document. As you said in Prague,=
 it is a matter of<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; defining some boundaries on the scope of=
 the document. What do<br>
&gt; &gt; you think?<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I would leave that for the authors and the group to =
decide. But<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; AFAIK there are a few major deployments / projects o=
ut there, such<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; as Freifunk (Germany), Guifi (Catalunia), Rhizomatic=
a (Mexico), and<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; perhaps Commotion (Tunisia, Redhook, Congo). Referen=
cing these could<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; bring the draft closer to actual practices (and with=
 that increase<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; relevance). Another approach could be providing a co=
ncrete example<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; for every topology you define under 4.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I completely agree with you that deployment experien=
ces should not<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; go into this draft, that would be too much. The same=
 is true for<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; providing an exhaustive list of implementations.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks in advance,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Hope this helps,<br>

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; For point 4, ... well, the decission=

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are required in here, then, we shoul=

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 0. The topic of the draf=
t is very relevant and timely and<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; brings together many dif=
ferent angles that are needed to<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; address the multidiscipl=

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and community owned<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; networks.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. The issue of the digi=
tal divide is approached from a<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;development studies=
&#39; paradigm (e.g. developing countries),<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; quite some scientific li=
terature has been published about<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this topic. Most current=
 literature acknowledges that for<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; instance term &#39;devel=
oping country&#39; is problematic because it<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; assumes that all countri=
es are on a similar trajectory, from<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;underdeveloped&#39;=
 to &#39;western&#39;.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Empirical data shows tha=
t this is not the case. More accurate<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would be to address diff=
erential developmental trajectories<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; by referring to the Glob=
al North vs. the Global South, or<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; using other frames.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Also terms like &#39;Dig=
ital Divide&#39;, &#39;Data Revolution&#39;,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;Information Society=
&#39; as well as the &#39;WSIS process&#39; have been<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dissected, discussed and=
 interpreted in quite a variety of<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ways. it might be good t=
o engage with the literature on this<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; if you would like to use=
 these terms, and if so, refer to the<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; relevant sources.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Same is true for the met=

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that is mentioned in the=

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; representing a quite mul=
tifaceted process of technology<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; appropriation and develo=

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In terms of methodology:=
 you are clearly coming at this<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; problem from a multidisc=
iplinary approach. Which is great,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; considering the multidis=
ciplinary nature of the Internet and<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the problem you are addr=
essing. However, if you do decide to<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; use concepts from differ=
ent fields and disciplines (like for<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; instance urban and rural=
 from urban planning, demand and<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; provision from economics=
 or the digital divide from<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sociology) it is importa=
nt to make this explicit. I would<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; suggest adding a sub-sec=
tion in which you explain how you<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; built your multidiscipli=
nary research method and why you use<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the concepts you applied=
.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. There is a lot of dou=
bling between abstract and<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; introduction. I recommen=
d reducing the abstract.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 3. The discussion under =
point 1. and 2. is maybe not<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; necessary for achieving =
the goal of providing a a taxonomy of<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; alternative network depl=
oyments. However, Maybe the first<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; part could be shorter.<b=

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 4. It could perhaps be i=
nteresting to provide some additional<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; information on actual al=
ternative network deployments,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; perhaps by providing som=
e case studies and, on the basis of<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; these, a set of best pra=

Hi,

We agree with Lars. As all the discussion has been done in the list, we 
have no problem on discussing in there.

IMHO, everyone had the option to incude their view. We have discussed 
the document since June 2014, and we have got contributions from many 
people, including community networks. In fact, some paragraphs have been 
contributed by active members of CNs (you can see it in the XML file, 
where comments have been adding reflecting the author of each part). Our 
intention was to reach a wide consensus, and we thought we had got it, 
according to the WG last call.

However, it seems there are still some concerns. So please send your 
comments to the GAIA list.

Thanks again,

Jose
PS: I am going on holidays today, so I will not be available for a week.

Hi, Aldebaro.

=20

Thank you for your detailed comments. We already corrected the typos you
reported in 1).

=20

Regarding the other suggestions, I will send 4 different e-mails, in =
order
to separate the discussion.

(I start my comments with [JS])

=20

Suggestion #1

=20

Current version:

   As stated in previous sections, Alternative Networks are composed of

   possibly different layer 2 devices, resulting in a mesh of nodes.

   Connection between different nodes is not guaranteed and the link

   stability can vary strongly over time.  To tackle this, some

   Alternative Networks use mesh network routing protocols while other

   networks use more traditional routing protocols.  Some networks

   operate multiple routing protocols in parallel.  For example, they

   use a mesh protocol inside different islands and use traditional

   routing protocols to connect these islands.

=20

Opinion:

   While nowadays most alternative networks rely on unlicensed spectrum

   and WiFi, 3GPP technologies are also used and, IMHO, may play an

   important role in future. As you know, companies such as [Endaga]

   and [Range] are offering GSM solutions, and there are solid

   initiatives towards LTE / 4G [IEEE-SDR]. In this context, I think

   the assumption in the above paragraph that alternative networks

   necessarily use mesh should be avoided.

=20

[JS] Well, I don=92t really think our paragraph says that alternative =
networks
necessarily use mesh. In fact, it says that =93some Alternative Networks =
use
mesh network routing protocols while other networks use more traditional
routing protocols.=94 Nevertheless, we could perhaps improve that =
paragraph.
In addition, we could use the three references you provide, in order to
improve other sections (e.g. 6.2.1.2).

=20

Thanks,

=20

Jose

Hello,

I have recently joined the GAIA group and found
draft-irtf-gaia-alternative-network-deployments-03.txt very
interesting. I am not sure if this is the proper way of contributing,
but I am sending attached some suggestions.

PS: Our university (UFPA) has partnership with Brazilian
institutions to provide telephony services and Internet via GPRS to
underserved (and very poor) communities in the Amazon forest. We are
then biased towards using GSM due e.g. to the low cost of the handsets.

Regards,
Aldebaro

Dear Niels,

First of all, thank you very much for your detailed review. As said
today, your comments will be useful for building an improved version.

My pleasure!
=20
=20

But I think here is something we should decide now: what to do
about "deployment experiences", i.e. point 4 of your review.
=20

4. It could perhaps be interesting to provide some
additional information on actual alternative network
deployments, perhaps by providing some case studies and,
on the basis of these, a set of best practices /
recommendations for specific situations.

=20
As Javier says, we have discussed this possibility in the GAIA
meeting in Prague
(https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/93/minutes/minutes-93-gaia):
=20
"Lixia Zhang: The Internet didn=92t start as a community effort. On
the draft, what is the main purpose? I=92m interested in what you
have learned, and what advice you may have.
=20
Niels ten Oever: This is a great overview, but how will you set
boundaries. There are lots of handbook materials that could be
linked to, to avoid making this draft grow to 100s of pages. In
particular we could define more on centralised v. decentralised
approaches.
=20
Jane Coffin: Energy is also important for rural areas.
=20
Mat: I think the original motivation was to get a definition of
=93Alternative Networks=94, it=92s not scoped to be 100s of pages, but
more can we define what we mean as Alternative Networks, and then
provide examples. Lixia=92s suggestion of looking at learning
outcomes, could be a future document that may be useful."
=20
=20
We also talked about that in the list, and we (more or less)
agreed on this solution: to first focus on a "taxonomy" draft, and
leave "deployment experiences" for future work.
http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/gaia/current/msg00831.html
=20
In fact, we already removed some content from the draft, as it was
related to "deployment experiences". See parts removed from Section
4 in these two versions:
https://www.ietf.org/rfcdiff?url1=3Ddraft-irtf-gaia-alternative-network-

deployments-01&url2=3Ddraft-irtf-gaia-alternative-network-deployments-00

=20
=20
=20

And we have also asked for volunteers for the "deployment

experiences" draft:
http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/gaia/current/msg00916.html
=20
=20
So my opinion is that we should avoid including this in the
present document. As you said in Prague, it is a matter of defining
some boundaries on the scope of the document. What do you think?
=20

=20
I would leave that for the authors and the group to decide. But AFAIK
there are a few major deployments / projects out there, such as
Freifunk (Germany), Guifi (Catalunia), Rhizomatica (Mexico), and
perhaps Commotion (Tunisia, Redhook, Congo). Referencing these could
bring the draft closer to actual practices (and with that increase
relevance). Another approach could be providing a concrete example for
every topology you define under 4.
=20
I completely agree with you that deployment experiences should not go
into this draft, that would be too much. The same is true for
providing an exhaustive list of implementations.
=20

Thanks in advance,

=20
Hope this helps,

For the most important points (the most detailed ones), there are
a few good interdisciplinary people in this lists with a
background in development studies. I guess that it is just a
matter of these people polishing the text.
=20
For point 4, ... well, the decission after Prague was to TAKE
OUT the experiences and build another document. If experiences
are required in here, then, we should reverse that decission and
pilot a controlled introduction of best practices / case studies
in the appropriate subsections.

=20
0. The topic of the draft is very relevant and timely and
brings together many different angles that are needed to
address the multidisciplinary nature of access, the
Internet, and community owned

networks.

=20
1. The issue of the digital divide is approached from a
'development studies' paradigm (e.g. developing
countries), quite some scientific literature has been
published about this topic. Most current literature
acknowledges that for instance term 'developing country' is
problematic because it assumes that all countries are on a
similar trajectory, from 'underdeveloped' to 'western'.
Empirical data shows that this is not the case. More
accurate would be to address differential developmental
trajectories by referring to the Global North vs. the
Global South, or using other frames.
=20
Also terms like 'Digital Divide', 'Data Revolution',
'Information Society' as well as the 'WSIS process' have
been dissected, discussed and interpreted in quite a
variety of ways. it might be good to engage with the
literature on this if you would like to use these terms,
and if so, refer to the relevant sources.
=20
Same is true for the method or model of knowledge transfer
that is mentioned in the draft. At several places it is
implied that knowledge travels from North to South and
from Urban to Rural, which might be a one dimensional way
of representing a quite multifaceted process of technology
appropriation and development.
=20
In terms of methodology: you are clearly coming at this
problem from a multidisciplinary approach. Which is great,
considering the multidisciplinary nature of the Internet
and the problem you are addressing. However, if you do
decide to use concepts from different fields and
disciplines (like for instance urban and rural from urban
planning, demand and provision from economics or the
digital divide from sociology) it is important to make this
explicit. I would suggest adding a sub-section in which you
explain how you built your multidisciplinary research
method and why you use the concepts you applied.
=20
2. There is a lot of doubling between abstract and
introduction. I recommend reducing the abstract.
=20
3. The discussion under point 1. and 2. is maybe not
necessary for achieving the goal of providing a a taxonomy
of alternative network deployments. However, Maybe the
first part could be shorter.
=20
4. It could perhaps be interesting to provide some
additional information on actual alternative network
deployments, perhaps by providing some case studies and,
on the basis of these, a set of best practices /
recommendations for specific situations.

   from the IEEE Standard Association's IEEE 802 Working Group.

   Standards developed by other international entities can also be used,

   as e.g. the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI).

Hello,

I have recently joined the GAIA group and found
draft-irtf-gaia-alternative-network-deployments-03.txt very
interesting. I am not sure if this is the proper way of contributing,
but I am sending attached some suggestions.

PS: Our university (UFPA) has partnership with Brazilian
institutions to provide telephony services and Internet via GPRS to
underserved (and very poor) communities in the Amazon forest. We are
then biased towards using GSM due e.g. to the low cost of the handsets.

Regards,
Aldebaro

First of all, thank you very much for your detailed review. As said
today, your comments will be useful for building an improved version.

My pleasure!
=20
=20

But I think here is something we should decide now: what to do
about "deployment experiences", i.e. point 4 of your review.
=20

4. It could perhaps be interesting to provide some
additional information on actual alternative network
deployments, perhaps by providing some case studies and,
on the basis of these, a set of best practices /
recommendations for specific situations.

=20
As Javier says, we have discussed this possibility in the GAIA
meeting in Prague
(https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/93/minutes/minutes-93-gaia):
=20
"Lixia Zhang: The Internet didn=92t start as a community effort. On
the draft, what is the main purpose? I=92m interested in what you
have learned, and what advice you may have.
=20
Niels ten Oever: This is a great overview, but how will you set
boundaries. There are lots of handbook materials that could be
linked to, to avoid making this draft grow to 100s of pages. In
particular we could define more on centralised v. decentralised
approaches.
=20
Jane Coffin: Energy is also important for rural areas.
=20
Mat: I think the original motivation was to get a definition of
=93Alternative Networks=94, it=92s not scoped to be 100s of pages, but
more can we define what we mean as Alternative Networks, and then
provide examples. Lixia=92s suggestion of looking at learning
outcomes, could be a future document that may be useful."
=20
=20
We also talked about that in the list, and we (more or less)
agreed on this solution: to first focus on a "taxonomy" draft, and
leave "deployment experiences" for future work.
http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/gaia/current/msg00831.html
=20
In fact, we already removed some content from the draft, as it was
related to "deployment experiences". See parts removed from Section
4 in these two versions:
https://www.ietf.org/rfcdiff?url1=3Ddraft-irtf-gaia-alternative-network-

deployments-01&url2=3Ddraft-irtf-gaia-alternative-network-deployments-00

=20
=20
=20

And we have also asked for volunteers for the "deployment

experiences" draft:
http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/gaia/current/msg00916.html
=20
=20
So my opinion is that we should avoid including this in the
present document. As you said in Prague, it is a matter of defining
some boundaries on the scope of the document. What do you think?
=20

=20
I would leave that for the authors and the group to decide. But AFAIK
there are a few major deployments / projects out there, such as
Freifunk (Germany), Guifi (Catalunia), Rhizomatica (Mexico), and
perhaps Commotion (Tunisia, Redhook, Congo). Referencing these could
bring the draft closer to actual practices (and with that increase
relevance). Another approach could be providing a concrete example for
every topology you define under 4.
=20
I completely agree with you that deployment experiences should not go
into this draft, that would be too much. The same is true for
providing an exhaustive list of implementations.
=20

Thanks in advance,

=20
Hope this helps,

For the most important points (the most detailed ones), there are
a few good interdisciplinary people in this lists with a
background in development studies. I guess that it is just a
matter of these people polishing the text.
=20
For point 4, ... well, the decission after Prague was to TAKE
OUT the experiences and build another document. If experiences
are required in here, then, we should reverse that decission and
pilot a controlled introduction of best practices / case studies
in the appropriate subsections.

=20
0. The topic of the draft is very relevant and timely and
brings together many different angles that are needed to
address the multidisciplinary nature of access, the
Internet, and community owned

networks.

=20
1. The issue of the digital divide is approached from a
'development studies' paradigm (e.g. developing
countries), quite some scientific literature has been
published about this topic. Most current literature
acknowledges that for instance term 'developing country' is
problematic because it assumes that all countries are on a
similar trajectory, from 'underdeveloped' to 'western'.
Empirical data shows that this is not the case. More
accurate would be to address differential developmental
trajectories by referring to the Global North vs. the
Global South, or using other frames.
=20
Also terms like 'Digital Divide', 'Data Revolution',
'Information Society' as well as the 'WSIS process' have
been dissected, discussed and interpreted in quite a
variety of ways. it might be good to engage with the
literature on this if you would like to use these terms,
and if so, refer to the relevant sources.
=20
Same is true for the method or model of knowledge transfer
that is mentioned in the draft. At several places it is
implied that knowledge travels from North to South and
from Urban to Rural, which might be a one dimensional way
of representing a quite multifaceted process of technology
appropriation and development.
=20
In terms of methodology: you are clearly coming at this
problem from a multidisciplinary approach. Which is great,
considering the multidisciplinary nature of the Internet
and the problem you are addressing. However, if you do
decide to use concepts from different fields and
disciplines (like for instance urban and rural from urban
planning, demand and provision from economics or the
digital divide from sociology) it is important to make this
explicit. I would suggest adding a sub-section in which you
explain how you built your multidisciplinary research
method and why you use the concepts you applied.
=20
2. There is a lot of doubling between abstract and
introduction. I recommend reducing the abstract.
=20
3. The discussion under point 1. and 2. is maybe not
necessary for achieving the goal of providing a a taxonomy
of alternative network deployments. However, Maybe the
first part could be shorter.
=20
4. It could perhaps be interesting to provide some
additional information on actual alternative network
deployments, perhaps by providing some case studies and,
on the basis of these, a set of best practices /
recommendations for specific situations.

is mentioned in the draft. At several places it =
is<o:p></o:p></pre><pre>implied that knowledge travels from North to =

(like for instance urban and rural from =
urban<o:p></o:p></pre><pre>planning, demand and provision from economics =

important to make this<o:p></o:p></pre><pre>explicit. I would suggest =

Suggestion #3

=20

Current version:

   GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications), from ETSI, has also

   been used in Alternative Networks as a Layer 2 option, as explained

   in [Mexican], [Village], [Heimerl].

=20

Opinion:

   Item 6.2.1.2 could be expanded to include other 3GPP technologies,

   such as 3G, 4G/LTE [IEEE-SDR] and 5G [OpenAir], mentioning systems

   such as [OpenBTS], [OpenBSC] and [YateBTS]. If this is reasonable,=20

   I could try to expand it.

Those ideas that are only in a first research stage can be reported, but
only as =93recent efforts=94 or =93future possibilities=94.

If you could expand the text, including these references, and stating =

current status of each of them, we can discuss it with the people in the

Hello,

I have recently joined the GAIA group and found
draft-irtf-gaia-alternative-network-deployments-03.txt very
interesting. I am not sure if this is the proper way of contributing,
but I am sending attached some suggestions.

PS: Our university (UFPA) has partnership with Brazilian
institutions to provide telephony services and Internet via GPRS to
underserved (and very poor) communities in the Amazon forest. We are
then biased towards using GSM due e.g. to the low cost of the handsets.

Regards,
Aldebaro

Dear Niels,

First of all, thank you very much for your detailed review. As said
today, your comments will be useful for building an improved version.
=20

=20
My pleasure!
=20
=20

But I think here is something we should decide now: what to do
about "deployment experiences", i.e. point 4 of your review.
=20

4. It could perhaps be interesting to provide some
additional information on actual alternative network
deployments, perhaps by providing some case studies and,
on the basis of these, a set of best practices /
recommendations for specific situations.

=20
As Javier says, we have discussed this possibility in the GAIA
meeting in Prague
(https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/93/minutes/minutes-93-gaia):
=20
"Lixia Zhang: The Internet didn=92t start as a community effort. On
the draft, what is the main purpose? I=92m interested in what you
have learned, and what advice you may have.
=20
Niels ten Oever: This is a great overview, but how will you set
boundaries. There are lots of handbook materials that could be
linked to, to avoid making this draft grow to 100s of pages. In
particular we could define more on centralised v. decentralised
approaches.
=20
Jane Coffin: Energy is also important for rural areas.
=20
Mat: I think the original motivation was to get a definition of
=93Alternative Networks=94, it=92s not scoped to be 100s of pages, but
more can we define what we mean as Alternative Networks, and then
provide examples. Lixia=92s suggestion of looking at learning
outcomes, could be a future document that may be useful."
=20
=20
We also talked about that in the list, and we (more or less)
agreed on this solution: to first focus on a "taxonomy" draft, and
leave "deployment experiences" for future work.
http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/gaia/current/msg00831.html
=20
In fact, we already removed some content from the draft, as it was
related to "deployment experiences". See parts removed from Section
4 in these two versions:
https://www.ietf.org/rfcdiff?url1=3Ddraft-irtf-gaia-alternative-network-

deployments-01&url2=3Ddraft-irtf-gaia-alternative-network-deployments-00

=20
=20
=20

And we have also asked for volunteers for the "deployment

experiences" draft:
http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/gaia/current/msg00916.html
=20
=20
So my opinion is that we should avoid including this in the
present document. As you said in Prague, it is a matter of defining
some boundaries on the scope of the document. What do you think?
=20

=20
I would leave that for the authors and the group to decide. But AFAIK
there are a few major deployments / projects out there, such as
Freifunk (Germany), Guifi (Catalunia), Rhizomatica (Mexico), and
perhaps Commotion (Tunisia, Redhook, Congo). Referencing these could
bring the draft closer to actual practices (and with that increase
relevance). Another approach could be providing a concrete example for
every topology you define under 4.
=20
I completely agree with you that deployment experiences should not go
into this draft, that would be too much. The same is true for
providing an exhaustive list of implementations.
=20

Thanks in advance,

=20
Hope this helps,

For the most important points (the most detailed ones), there are
a few good interdisciplinary people in this lists with a
background in development studies. I guess that it is just a
matter of these people polishing the text.
=20
For point 4, ... well, the decission after Prague was to TAKE
OUT the experiences and build another document. If experiences
are required in here, then, we should reverse that decission and
pilot a controlled introduction of best practices / case studies
in the appropriate subsections.

0. The topic of the draft is very relevant and timely and
brings together many different angles that are needed to
address the multidisciplinary nature of access, the
Internet, and community owned

networks.

=20
1. The issue of the digital divide is approached from a
'development studies' paradigm (e.g. developing
countries), quite some scientific literature has been
published about this topic. Most current literature
acknowledges that for instance term 'developing country' is
problematic because it assumes that all countries are on a
similar trajectory, from 'underdeveloped' to 'western'.
Empirical data shows that this is not the case. More
accurate would be to address differential developmental
trajectories by referring to the Global North vs. the
Global South, or using other frames.
=20
Also terms like 'Digital Divide', 'Data Revolution',
'Information Society' as well as the 'WSIS process' have
been dissected, discussed and interpreted in quite a
variety of ways. it might be good to engage with the
literature on this if you would like to use these terms,
and if so, refer to the relevant sources.
=20
Same is true for the method or model of knowledge transfer
that is mentioned in the draft. At several places it is
implied that knowledge travels from North to South and
from Urban to Rural, which might be a one dimensional way
of representing a quite multifaceted process of technology
appropriation and development.
=20
In terms of methodology: you are clearly coming at this
problem from a multidisciplinary approach. Which is great,
considering the multidisciplinary nature of the Internet
and the problem you are addressing. However, if you do
decide to use concepts from different fields and
disciplines (like for instance urban and rural from urban
planning, demand and provision from economics or the
digital divide from sociology) it is important to make this
explicit. I would suggest adding a sub-section in which you
explain how you built your multidisciplinary research
method and why you use the concepts you applied.
=20
2. There is a lot of doubling between abstract and
introduction. I recommend reducing the abstract.
=20
3. The discussion under point 1. and 2. is maybe not
necessary for achieving the goal of providing a a taxonomy
of alternative network deployments. However, Maybe the
first part could be shorter.
=20
4. It could perhaps be interesting to provide some
additional information on actual alternative network
deployments, perhaps by providing some case studies and,
on the basis of these, a set of best practices /
recommendations for specific situations.

Suggestion #4:

=20

Current version:

   5.  Classification of Alternative Networks

     5.1.  Community Networks

     5.2.  Wireless Internet Service Providers, WISPs

     5.3.  Shared infrastructure model

     5.4.  Crowdshared approaches, led by the users and third party

           stakeholders

     5.5.  Testbeds for research purposes

=20

Opinion:

   At least in academia, I think it is hard to avoid using the term=20

   "Community Network" when describing a "Shared infrastructure model",

   for example, due to the importance and usage of "community". A

   search for "community networks" at IEEE Xplore returns 220 items.

   IMHO, this term could then be avoided as a specific

   classification to allow its general use, as a group of alternative

   networks. It seems more appropriate something like:

   5.  Classification of Alternative Networks

     5.1.  Large Scale Free and Open Community Networks

     5.2.  Wireless Internet Service Providers, WISPs

     5.3.  Shared Infrastructure

     5.4.  Crowdshared

     5.5.  Testbeds for research purposes

   And 5.3 could be eventually called "Shared Radio Access and/or

   Backhaul Infrastructure".

=20

[JS] In this case, I don=92t think it is a good idea to change the =
names=85 we
have been discussing this for more than 21 months, and we have reached
consensus in the list. I mean, the draft is in the =93IRSG Poll=94 =
status, so I
think it is not a good idea to re-open the discussion about the
classification and names again.

=20

However, let=92s see the opinion of the people in the list.

Thanks

Hello,

I have recently joined the GAIA group and found
draft-irtf-gaia-alternative-network-deployments-03.txt very
interesting. I am not sure if this is the proper way of contributing,
but I am sending attached some suggestions.

PS: Our university (UFPA) has partnership with Brazilian
institutions to provide telephony services and Internet via GPRS to
underserved (and very poor) communities in the Amazon forest. We are
then biased towards using GSM due e.g. to the low cost of the handsets.

Regards,
Aldebaro

But I think here is something we should decide now: what to do
about "deployment experiences", i.e. point 4 of your review.
=20

4. It could perhaps be interesting to provide some
additional information on actual alternative network
deployments, perhaps by providing some case studies and,
on the basis of these, a set of best practices /
recommendations for specific situations.

=20
As Javier says, we have discussed this possibility in the GAIA
meeting in Prague
(https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/93/minutes/minutes-93-gaia):
=20
"Lixia Zhang: The Internet didn=92t start as a community effort. On
the draft, what is the main purpose? I=92m interested in what you
have learned, and what advice you may have.
=20
Niels ten Oever: This is a great overview, but how will you set
boundaries. There are lots of handbook materials that could be
linked to, to avoid making this draft grow to 100s of pages. In
particular we could define more on centralised v. decentralised
approaches.
=20
Jane Coffin: Energy is also important for rural areas.
=20
Mat: I think the original motivation was to get a definition of
=93Alternative Networks=94, it=92s not scoped to be 100s of pages, but
more can we define what we mean as Alternative Networks, and then
provide examples. Lixia=92s suggestion of looking at learning
outcomes, could be a future document that may be useful."
=20
=20
We also talked about that in the list, and we (more or less)
agreed on this solution: to first focus on a "taxonomy" draft, and
leave "deployment experiences" for future work.
http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/gaia/current/msg00831.html
=20
In fact, we already removed some content from the draft, as it was
related to "deployment experiences". See parts removed from Section
4 in these two versions:
https://www.ietf.org/rfcdiff?url1=3Ddraft-irtf-gaia-alternative-network-

deployments-01&url2=3Ddraft-irtf-gaia-alternative-network-deployments-00

=20
=20
=20

And we have also asked for volunteers for the "deployment

experiences" draft:
http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/gaia/current/msg00916.html
=20
=20
So my opinion is that we should avoid including this in the
present document. As you said in Prague, it is a matter of defining
some boundaries on the scope of the document. What do you think?
=20

=20
I would leave that for the authors and the group to decide. But AFAIK
there are a few major deployments / projects out there, such as
Freifunk (Germany), Guifi (Catalunia), Rhizomatica (Mexico), and
perhaps Commotion (Tunisia, Redhook, Congo). Referencing these could
bring the draft closer to actual practices (and with that increase
relevance). Another approach could be providing a concrete example for
every topology you define under 4.
=20
I completely agree with you that deployment experiences should not go
into this draft, that would be too much. The same is true for
providing an exhaustive list of implementations.
=20

Thanks in advance,

=20
Hope this helps,

For the most important points (the most detailed ones), there are
a few good interdisciplinary people in this lists with a
background in development studies. I guess that it is just a
matter of these people polishing the text.
=20
For point 4, ... well, the decission after Prague was to TAKE
OUT the experiences and build another document. If experiences
are required in here, then, we should reverse that decission and
pilot a controlled introduction of best practices / case studies
in the appropriate subsections.

0. The topic of the draft is very relevant and timely and
brings together many different angles that are needed to
address the multidisciplinary nature of access, the
Internet, and community owned

networks.

=20
1. The issue of the digital divide is approached from a
'development studies' paradigm (e.g. developing
countries), quite some scientific literature has been
published about this topic. Most current literature
acknowledges that for instance term 'developing country' is
problematic because it assumes that all countries are on a
similar trajectory, from 'underdeveloped' to 'western'.
Empirical data shows that this is not the case. More
accurate would be to address differential developmental
trajectories by referring to the Global North vs. the
Global South, or using other frames.
=20
Also terms like 'Digital Divide', 'Data Revolution',
'Information Society' as well as the 'WSIS process' have
been dissected, discussed and interpreted in quite a
variety of ways. it might be good to engage with the
literature on this if you would like to use these terms,
and if so, refer to the relevant sources.
=20
Same is true for the method or model of knowledge transfer
that is mentioned in the draft. At several places it is
implied that knowledge travels from North to South and
from Urban to Rural, which might be a one dimensional way
of representing a quite multifaceted process of technology
appropriation and development.
=20
In terms of methodology: you are clearly coming at this
problem from a multidisciplinary approach. Which is great,
considering the multidisciplinary nature of the Internet
and the problem you are addressing. However, if you do
decide to use concepts from different fields and
disciplines (like for instance urban and rural from urban
planning, demand and provision from economics or the
digital divide from sociology) it is important to make this
explicit. I would suggest adding a sub-section in which you
explain how you built your multidisciplinary research
method and why you use the concepts you applied.
=20
2. There is a lot of doubling between abstract and
introduction. I recommend reducing the abstract.
=20
3. The discussion under point 1. and 2. is maybe not
necessary for achieving the goal of providing a a taxonomy
of alternative network deployments. However, Maybe the
first part could be shorter.
=20
4. It could perhaps be interesting to provide some
additional information on actual alternative network
deployments, perhaps by providing some case studies and,
on the basis of these, a set of best practices /
recommendations for specific situations.

i certainly can't and don't speak for any of these projects, but i 
thought the article was quite reasonable. i don't think it is suggesting 
that the regulatory issues are insuperable. it's mostly pointing out the 
obvious (treaty organization processes can be slow and 
non-deterministic) and then adds a lot of "may" and "not clear." but it 
also points out that the pitches seem to have gotten remarkable traction 
with the NRAs, who are the true sine qua non actors here.

Dear all,

I read your draft with great interest. Thank you for documenting Alternative 
Networks. I would like to offer some suggestions, with the goal to see the next 
version of the draft improved.

Disclaimer: this input is from me personally, and does not represent opinion of 
my employer.

While I am not an operator of any Alternative Network, I am a strong supporter, 
and community builder, connecting people, promoting initiatives and events, and 
documenting Alternative Networks, (mostly Community Networks): 
https://wiki.techinc.nl/index.php/MeshNet
& http://becha.home.xs4all.nl/hackers-philosophers-utopian-network-dec-2012-becha.pdf

My comments are of three kinds:
a) content of the current draft
b) suggestions about possible other content
c) editorial

I give my detailed comments in-line, while summarizing main points here:

a.1. rename the "commercial model/promoter" (4.1) as "ownership"
a.2. define Alternative Networks by themselves (1.2)
(not just as the "opposite" from "mainstream")

b)
- I am missing a final section: conclusions, recommendations, summary
- I love multidisciplinary approach, but please reflect this in the references: 
I would like to see more material from economists, social scientists, human 
rights and political activists, and philosophers;
I will include some links, and I will circulate this draft to my network of 
contacts for their input
- please increase the diversity: among authors, acknowledged supporters, 
examples & references there are not many women nor people from "Global South"; 
I will provide some input as the initial help.

I hope you find mine comments helpful.

Regards,
Vesna

c) I would take out the following part of the sentence, since "mainstream 
networks" are defined in more detail further in the document.

> where a company deploys the
>    infrastructure connecting the users, who pay a subscription fee to be
>    connected and make use of it.

(I would add this to 1.1.)

>    networks.

c) I think the following two paragraphs should be taken out, in order to make 
the document shorter; since it only repeats the listing of the types further in 
the document.

>    The classification considers several types of alternate deployments:
>    Community Networks are self-organized networks wholly owned by the
>    community; networks acting as Wireless Internet Service Providers
>    (WISPs); networks owned by individuals but leased out to network
>    operators who use such networks as a low cost medium to reach the
>    underserved population; and finally there are networks that provide
>    connectivity by sharing wireless resources of the users.

>    network operators.

</out>

On the other hand, I would like to add other motivators and goals of the 
Alternative Networks, such as
- increased freedoms of the participants in those networks,
- alternative approaches to ownership (commons and sharing as opposed to 
commercial ownership & exploitation),
- increases in the capacity for individuals to exercise their rights, need for 
the decentralized decisions making processes about network design, use, 
growth...

... and I think contributors from other disciplines could contribute to this 
part of the document.

(see references I mentioned in Section 2)

For example, part of 3.0 could be moved here:

> civil society members [are] more active in the search for
> alternatives to provide themselves with affordable access.
> Furthermore, Alternative Networks {could} contribute to other
> dimensions of the digital development like increased human capital

I suggest to add more here - specially about ownership:

(from the intro)

I strongly recommend to spell out HERE the characteristics of Alternative 
Networks. This document could become a standard for the definition of 
Alternative Networks, and this chapter could be that summary!

Suggestions:

+ Goals for building Alternative Networks are usually: empowering the community 
of participants and users, increasing access to connectivity, increasing 
digital literacy and enhancing and extending digital
human rights

+ Ownership: Alternative Networks are usually owned by the community, or shared 
between non-commercial and commercial entities

+ Regarding scale, they (Alternative Networks) are mostly spanning smaller 
areas

+ Administration is non-centralized, i.e. the network is managed following a 
distributed approach, in which a whole community may participate

+ Alternative Networks are usually self-managed and self-sustained (from 3.2.): 
users participate in the network design, deployment, operation and maintenance.

As I said, I love multidisciplinary approach, but please reflect this in the 
references: I would like to see more material from economists, social 
scientists, human rights and political activists, and philosophers:

Uh, that's a very traditional or neo-liberal economics! :(

I would hope that, at least in the document about Alternative Networks, 
"demand" would be possible to define in alternative ways too, and not only to 
"pay a price"?!

why "for sale"? The same comment as above -- in alternative economies, there 
are other mechanisms -- sometimes it's not "for sale", it is for "contribution" 
or for "sharing" or ...

But why?! I think this deserves some extra explanation or references.

However, this below could be moved to "goals" in the introduction or chapter 
4.2. :

>    Community Networks) sets a precedent for civil society members to

I think the above sentence should be split in two:

> [There are] certain challenges to the[ir] stability and the services
> the[y] [Alternative Networks] aim to provide:
> scarcity of spectrum, scale, and heterogeneity of devices.

Please rename this section, and this concept, to "ownership".

Owning and ownership are mentioned later on, but not here - why?

Also, some of these models are *not* _commercial_ at all.

Why only rural?

Why all of a sudden a new terminology - industrialized, emerging markets? How 
does this relate to previous terminology? Can it be replaced with urban/rural, 
north/south?

I find lots of problems with this category, because of the mixing of the two 
approaches: commercial companies who use "pseudo-sharing" to achieve their 
commercial goals, *and* actual non-centralized sharing by users.

First group is NOT "non-centralized"; companies like FON, KPN (Holland), 
Comcast (USA), SBB (Serbia) have their centralized infrastructure, and users 
can not influence the "sharing" or use of their equipment.

Often, if these users do not like the "mandatory sharing", they can not even 
"vote with their wallet" (again neo-liberal, free market terminology ;-) , 
because sometimes those providers have a monopoly (or duopoly) and are the only 
provider in that area...

>    These networks can be defined as a set of nodes whose owners share
>    common interests (e.g. sharing connectivity; resources; peripherals)
>    regardless of their physical location.  They conform to the following

>    is normally used by the owner,

Often, the equipment is NOT owned by users, but "given" (sold, leased) to them 
by the commercial ISP.

>
>    In the same way, some companies [Fon] promote the use of Wi-Fi

But it's not really "shared", since only the *customers* of the same 
_commercial ISP_ can "share" with each other.

This is not a true community, it's the commercial customers of the commercial 
provider.

...

Again, I think that this category should be split between "providers" that 
offer this as a part of their commercial business model; and the "movement" in 
which the users themselves are organised in another way, and are truly sharing 
the resources.

Hi, Vesna,

First of all, thank you very much for your feedback. We will take it =
into account for the next version.

The only question is that (IMHO) we should avoid strong changes at this =
stage. The draft is currently in "IRSG poll", after the WG last call, =
and after a thorough revision by Niels (the reviewer assigned by the =
IRSG). We will try to incorporate as many improvements as possible, as =
long as they seem reasonable and don't significantly change the =
structure of the document.

Thanks!

Jose
