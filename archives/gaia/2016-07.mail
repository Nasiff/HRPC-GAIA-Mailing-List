Information Centric Networking (ICN) has emerged as a promising paradigm =
for shaping the Future Internet (FI) architectures, oriented towards the =
management of the massive amount of information. ICN moves from the =
host-centric to the information-centric networking to decouple the =
delivery of contents from their original locations. This new paradigm =
allows the fetching and pre-fetching of contents and services from =
virtually everywhere, including pushing the information closer to the =
end user. The latter aspect allows optimizing bandwidth utilization and =
improving the service availability, especially in challenged network =
environments. Particular ICN aspects that facilitate such optimization =
are, among others, the support for in-network caching, the convenient =
naming of content while only creating temporary relationships between =
those providing and those asking for content, or the potential to =
utilize multipath communication and supporting multicast delivery (due =
to the spatial and temporary decoupling of publishers and subscribers). =
One benefit from this optimization is to provide a unified framework to =
integrate constrained-resourced edge networks (e.g., Internet of Things) =
and high capacity core networks.

In most developing regions, residential Internet access is considerably =
less affordable due to the experienced income levels. People living in =
rural communities of these regions either suffer from lacking of =
Internet access or poor Internet connectivity. These conditions have led =
to a limited opportunity for rural communities to connect to the world =
and has significantly caused a digital divide. The advantages offered by =
ICN along with wireless access and distribution technologies (TV White =
Spaces, satellite communications or Wi-Fi based long distance networks) =
introduce potential to improve the Internet connectivity in developing =
regions aiming at minimizing the cost of Internet deployment and =
potentially allowing commodity hardware to be an alternative. =
Furthermore, the recent rising of localized communication approaches, =
e.g., community networks and do-it-yourself networking (DIY) also bring =
benefits on providing a low-cost solution for network deployment. With =
the efficient content delivery in ICN and low-cost practical solutions, =
these capabilities will leverage affordable broadband Internet for the =
developing regions.


The topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

* ICN architecture design and evaluation

* ICN integration with current IP-based services

* Use of wireless access technologies for development such as TV White =
Spaces, satellite communications or Wi-Fi based long distance networks

* Caching technologies

* ICN integration with Alternative Network Deployments

* Integrated Internet of Things and ICN solutions for the developing =
world

* Privacy, security and trust for Future Internet architectures

* Localized communication networks and edge computing

* Applications and services for developing regions

* Future Internet economics and business models

* Deployment and trial experiences of ICN systems

Dear Amali De Silva,

many many thanks for your initiative in this environment to discuss this 
theme. One of the most important question for us. I have addressed many 
lists. And i know, many friends act on different lists. Maybe, sometimes 
we bring the different discussions together.

This question is not only for jobless people or for that, what some 
people say, "extension of human capital". A terrible term.

We act, or the most of us, for a telecommunication that can interconnect 
all people on our planet. And we do it mostly, because we have the 
experience, how strong was this system to help us in our own development 
and activity.

But we have also another layer. We say, all this terrible destruction of 
nature, culture, history, knowledge and so on, what we see in the last 
decades, centuries and so on, we can stop, if the people are interconnected.

And, in a positive direction, all our understanding of the laws of the 
nature, the basic for our technology, the materialisation of the law of 
the nature, we can strong accelerate, if we cooperate globally in an 
free and open space for all people. A fantastic perspective.

Then we never will have any problem with the development and 
distribution of our Internet. For that we can say: the inter-connection 
of any device or the inter-connection of all local networks with her 
devices. Physically, of course, all devices. And the people use the 
devices for her communication and information exchange.

We know, knowledge is a common resource. We know it from ourself, we 
know it from other people. All our knowledge is based on that, what 
other people before and today created and published. Never any person 
alone can work.

The patent rights suggest, we as a individual person can create 
something alone. This is a big nonsense, a religion. But we, with our 
experience and understanding, can say, we ignore all this nonsense. We 
never use it, we never recognize it. It is more a decision for us self, 
like with all religions. They are depend, that the people believe.

And we have the experience, that if nobody follow, nothing exist of 
that. Only a paper maybe.

I speak here consciously to a group of enlightened people. And i speak 
here to activist for a free and open interconnection of all people on 
our planet. I am atheist and i go only in a church to see the used 
technology in our history. Therefore, i am not interested for dogmatic 
propaganda.

In my concentration to the internet the technology to realize stay 
always in the foreground. The first part, the theoretical discussion 
about structures and methodologies, is for me clear. We have it, if we want.

The transport of the digital data in packetform over any geografical 
distances is the most important part, what we have to organice. And not 
with Kb, Mb, or little Gb. No, with Tb. But i know, that in this lists 
the most people people don't like to work with experimental and 
theoretical physic. They like more to repeat all this Governance 
rethoric. Papers for papaers, texts for texts. Endless without a clear 
perspective.

We know, our Internet we can only create in a global cooperation in the 
technical sphere. The people in the regions have to be able to organize 
the internet in his region. And only the IP header we need for our 
interoperability. That we understand the elements in this language. And 
how we transport the data is not important. Only the non-alteration is 
important.

The result for me is the free technology. Free for participate, free for 
using the result, for all people on our planet. The principles: "global 
thinking, local doing" and "knowledge is always worldheritage".

many thanks and greetings, willi
Manaus, Brasil

Betreff: [governance] management of technology patents, licenses and 
royalty agreements focus group on impacts for labour / jobs, not just IT 
skills
Datum: Fri, 15 Jul 2016 04:09:36 +0000 (UTC)
Von: amalidesilva@yahoo.com <amalidesilva@yahoo.com>
An: Internet Governance <governance@lists.igcaucus.org>

Just a thought....

Civil society should build a focus group in the area of patents, 
licensing and technologies as it impacts labour supply not just skills, 
as it is a key to the allocation of wealth and the management of labour 
(job loss, is not just skills related it is actual displacement ) in to 
the future, if global birth rates are sustained at current levels...this 
is about access to technology.

In the past WSIS stakeholders have really promoted sharing of 
technological knowledge...so we have already have an early interest in 
this area of work and the monitoring of it....

Simple example. If the recipe for making cakes had not been shared but 
patented , there would be one global baker using a robot cake machine 
  and not a cake baker in every city as now...so lots of cake making 
jobs were sustained...Even the most complex of technology developments 
may have to take this route for evolution at a certain level , whatever 
that level may be, to minimize net job loss in the interim / short term 
for social stability....this may also provide enhanced creative 
opportunities for the future...

Job losses of the future must be managed by society as the numbers will 
be too large to be easily assimilated by the general job market place 
  plus..to address the current IT skills gap , civil society should 
actively support the IT education of the 40 to 65 year olds ...in to the 
future we will need less technically qualified people as AI develops 
sophistication....this is the real issue then...and we need to start 
planning now as the current global  talk suggests....

Amali De Silva - Mitchell...

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Global Access to the Internet for All of the IETF.

        Title           : Alternative Network Deployments: Taxonomy, characterization, technologies and architectures

	Date            : 2016-07-18

Abstract:
   This document presents a taxonomy of a set of "Alternative Network
   Deployments" that emerged in the last decade with the aim of bringing
   Internet connectivity to people or for providing local communication
   infrastructure to serve various complementary needs and objectives.
   They employ architectures and topologies different from those of
   mainstream networks, and rely on alternative governance and business
   models.

   The document also surveys the technologies deployed in these
   networks, and their differing architectural characteristics,
   including a set of definitions and shared properties.

   The classification considers models such as Community Networks,
   Wireless Internet Service Providers (WISPs), networks owned by
   individuals but leased out to network operators who use them as a
   low-cost medium to reach the underserved population, networks that
   provide connectivity by sharing wireless resources of the users and
   rural utility cooperatives.


The IETF datatracker status page for this draft is:

Dear friends,

what is that?

"has been rejected by the list moderator. The moderator gave the 
following reason for rejecting your request:
   "Your message was rejected""

Can me explain any intelligent person, what this stupid explanation 
should tell me?

In another mail to the "gaia-owner" i asked:
"please explain me the rules in the gaia list. In the info page i don't 
find any information for that.
Maybe:
- maxima recipients
- to/cc/bcc rules
- appends
- size
and so on."

Can me a person in this list give a answer to my question? The "owners" 
of this list are not able to do that.

many greetings, willi
Manaus, Brasil

Dear friends,

normally i act in such situation only with the admin group. But in 
gaia.irtf.org it is impossible. The admin group don't like to answer a 
question. Therefore i send it to the list.

"The message headers matched a filter rule". Ok, but what filter rule? I 
looked in the header and i don't see any problematic thing. Maybe, on 
the list are people, they know the specific irtf.org "filter rules"? I 
am very interested.

many greetings, willi
Manaus, Brasil

Dear willi,

Your original post was caught by a filter we have on postings to this =
list that catches anything that looks like a Call for Papers. Sometimes =
we then allow those postings because they are calling for input to =
events/workshops/confeences and so on that are related to the objectives =
of the GAIA RG.

In this case, your post does not seem to be related to the objectives of =
this RG (and was also very widely cross-posted) and so it was rejected.

As you can see from the above, the administrators of this group are =
quite happy to answer questions, but because they are human they =
sometimes need a little time, especially during busy weeks like IETF.

Regards,
Mat
