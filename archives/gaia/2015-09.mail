Hi all,

Since the last announcement of this event we had the coincidence of the =
newly announced Greek elections on the 20th of September so the =
organizing team has chosen to change the dates of the event to the 26th =
& 27th of September. Here in Greece many people have their electoral =
rights set to the area where they come from (aka villages, islands etc). =
This means that many of them leave Athens and have to go there to vote. =
This would greatly affect the proceedings of this event and moreover the =
general attendance so we decided to change the dates.

For your information I am forwarding you the relevant updated call.

Athens Wireless Summit 2015
Call for Participation / Talks

We are pleased to announce that Athens Wireless Metropolitan Network =
(AWMN) in collaboration with Greek Free/Open Source Software Society =
(GFOSS) and Sarantaporo.gr <http://sarantaporo.gr/> Non Profit =
Association is organizing a two day event titled =C2=ABA=E2=80=8Bthens =
Wireless Summit 2015=C2=BB=E2=80=8B. It will take place during the =
weekend of the 2=E2=80=8B6th and 27th =E2=80=8Bof September 2015 at =
Impact Hub Athens.

It would be our pleasure to have you there and we encourage you to =
participate or even give a talk or a workshop. Please send us your =
submission until the 13th of September 2015 in order to be able to =
announce the final agenda in time and further promote the event.

ACM DEV 2015
6th Symposium on Computing for Development
November 30 - December 2, 2015
London, United Kingdom
http://acmdev.org/

Important Dates:

Poster abstracts due: September 30, 2015 (11:59pm UTC) - firm deadline
Author notification: October 10, 2015
Camera-ready: October 17, 2015
Conference: November 30 - December 2, 2015


DEV 2015 provides an international forum for research in the design,
implementation, and evaluation of information and communication
technologies (ICTs) for social and economic development. In
particular, we focus on contexts where conventional computing
solutions are often inappropriate due to various contextual factors -
including, but not limited to: cost, language, literacy, and the
availability of power and bandwidth.

The poster deadline for DEV 2015 is September 30th. Posters must not
exceed 2 pages and all submissions must be in ACM format, submitted as
a PDF. Submissions should be fully anonymised; In particular, the
names or affiliations of authors should not be included so as to allow
for blind review. Posters should be submitted via the submission site.
Posters should describe original and previously unpublished research,
innovative experiments, and work in progress. All DEV poster
submissions should either provide or directly motivate a novel
technical solution that has direct implications for development.

The topic of ICT for development is inherently multidisciplinary, and
encompasses a broad array of fields within the computer science
discipline.  The ACM DEV conference is an opportunity for researchers
across these diverse fields of computer science to come together to
work on the common problem of improving access to and availability of
information and communication technology solutions.  In an effort to
encourage participation of researchers across the relevant domains,
this year the conference focuses on research at the interface of
computer science and development related to (but not limited to) the
following non-exclusive focus areas:

Systems, including:
- Low-cost connectivity and computing devices
- Network solutions for poorly connected regions, including white space spectrum
- Power-efficient systems
- Mobile systems and applications
- Special-purpose systems, e.g., sensors, wireless, IVR
- Systems challenges and opportunities in development, e.g., security,
sustainability, resilience
- Cellular phone systems and applications
- Novel tools and applications for development
- Measurements of existing technology in developing regions (e.g.
network deployments)

HCI, including:
- User interfaces for low-literacy populations
- Multi-lingual computing
- User interfaces for low-cost devices
- Participatory methods and user-centered design
- Accessibility to disabled populations in developing regions
- Design and evaluation of applications in health, microfinance,
education, agriculture, entertainment, social media
- Adapting content and applications to local languages and education levels
- Understanding social relationships and information flows in
disadvantaged societies

Data Science, including:
- Computational sustainability
- Computational social science
- Econometric models and developmental economics
- Data science for social good
- Machine learning techniques for large-scale data analysis in
development contexts
- Speech interfaces and translation for low-resource languages
- Computer vision challenges and opportunities in development
- Understanding social networks and digital media in developing regions

In addition, we welcome posters outside of the above topics that
address the DEV focus on computing innovations supporting social and
economic development.

CALL FOR PAPERS

Elsevier - Pervasive and Mobile Computing
Special Issue on
Pervasive Social Computing
=
http://www.journals.elsevier.com/pervasive-and-mobile-computing/call-for-p=
apers/

Submission Deadline: 30 November 2015

Pervasive Social Computing represents a new paradigm resulting from
the convergence of Pervasive Mobile Computing with Social Networking;
it aims to take advantage of human social relationships to enable the
attainment of users' tasks in different domains. On the one hand, the
impressive diffusion of Online Social Networking platforms is making
OSNs a pervasive tool for maintaining social relationships between
people. On the other hand, the diffusion of mobile personal devices
with rich networking and computing capabilities is fostering novel
patterns of users interactions through social networks, also depending
on the dynamic context and locations of the users. Last but not least,
pervasive mobile technologies enable completely novel types of social
networking applications and services, such as Mobile Social Networks.
The enormous potential of Pervasive Social Computing is leading
scientific communities in different disciplines, from computer science
to social science, communication science and economy, to analyze,
study and provide new theories, models, methods, technological
solutions and case studies. Interestingly, more and more Pervasive
Mobile Computing technologies are designed using inter-disciplinary
approaches, that exploit models of the users personal and social
behavior to design algorithms, protocols, services and applications.

The special issue aims to encourage the multidisciplinary discussion
involving academics, researchers and professionals on theories,
approaches, analysis, design and evaluation of services and networking
solutions for Pervasive Social Computing. Researchers are increasingly
interested in addressing a wide range of Pervasive Social Computing
challenges residing in Social networks and Social Computing systems
including: their architecture, algorithms and protocols for social
networking services, the creation of new analysis models, the
monitoring of emerging trends, studies on trust, privacy and security
issues and their potential applications.

The list of topics includes, but is not limited to:
- Security, privacy and trust in Pervasive Social Computing systems
- Innovative Pervasive Social Computing services and applications
- Architectures, algorithms and protocols for Pervasive Social
Computing systems
- Mobile networking solutions for Pervasive Social Computing
- Context modeling, reasoning and context awareness in Pervasive
Social Computing
- Pervasive sensing technologies applied to Pervasive Social Computing
- Opportunistic networking for Pervasive Social Computing
- Innovative Mobile Social Networking technologies and services
- Inter-disciplinary approaches to the design of Pervasive Social
Computing systems
- Analysis of users social interactions in mobile and pervasive social
networks
- Novel Online Social Networking services and users' behaviors enabled
by pervasive mobile networks
- Real experiences and experiments with Pervasive Social Computing
systems and applications
- Opportunistic and transient social interactions in Pervasive Social
Computing systems
- Social and economic models for Pervasive Social Computing systems
- Pervasive and social collaboration tools
- Impacts of Pervasive Social Computing on users' behaviour in
different domains (e.g. e-business, e-market, e-learning, e-health)

ACM DEV 2015
6th Symposium on Computing for Development
November 30 - December 2, 2015
London, United Kingdom
http://acmdev.org/

Important Dates:

Poster abstracts due: September 30, 2015 (11:59pm UTC) - firm deadline
Author notification: October 10, 2015
Camera-ready: October 17, 2015
Conference: November 30 - December 2, 2015


DEV 2015 provides an international forum for research in the design,
implementation, and evaluation of information and communication
technologies (ICTs) for social and economic development. In
particular, we focus on contexts where conventional computing
solutions are often inappropriate due to various contextual factors -
including, but not limited to: cost, language, literacy, and the
availability of power and bandwidth.

The poster deadline for DEV 2015 is September 30th. Posters must not
exceed 2 pages and all submissions must be in ACM format, submitted as
a PDF. Submissions should be fully anonymised; In particular, the
names or affiliations of authors should not be included so as to allow
for blind review. Posters should be submitted via the submission site.
Posters should describe original and previously unpublished research,
innovative experiments, and work in progress. All DEV poster
submissions should either provide or directly motivate a novel
technical solution that has direct implications for development.

The topic of ICT for development is inherently multidisciplinary, and
encompasses a broad array of fields within the computer science
discipline.  The ACM DEV conference is an opportunity for researchers
across these diverse fields of computer science to come together to
work on the common problem of improving access to and availability of
information and communication technology solutions.  In an effort to
encourage participation of researchers across the relevant domains,
this year the conference focuses on research at the interface of
computer science and development related to (but not limited to) the
following non-exclusive focus areas:

Systems, including:
- Low-cost connectivity and computing devices
- Network solutions for poorly connected regions, including white space spectrum
- Power-efficient systems
- Mobile systems and applications
- Special-purpose systems, e.g., sensors, wireless, IVR
- Systems challenges and opportunities in development, e.g., security,
sustainability, resilience
- Cellular phone systems and applications
- Novel tools and applications for development
- Measurements of existing technology in developing regions (e.g.

Hello all

We are happy in the TUCAN3G project today, and I want to share this with 
you.

Yesterday in Brussels, in a Technical Review of our project in the 
European Commission, we tested our "low-cost" 3G network that connects 
some villages in the Amazon forest in a pilot that illustrates the 
project's results. We had a first 3G phone call to a person in Varadero, 
a village by the Paranapura river (Amazon forest, Peru), and then a 
successful skype video session with a nomadic phone in the village.

The system is composed by a MPLS wireless multi-hop backhaul built up 
with Mikrotik WiFi routers and low-cost 3G outdoor IPaccess femtocells. 
The carrier is Telefonica, with the traffic being encapsulated in IPSec 
tunnels accross the rural part to Yurimaguas, where the tunnels continue 
through Telefonica's core network.

The rural backhaul network does not belong to the operator. It was 
deployed by IEEE HTC and a local University (PUCP) for use by the rural 
health facilities and is partially driven by the local government and 
partly by the communities. They share the bandwidth with the operator 
for the backhaul. The network will be fully operational for the people 
in a few days.

More info about our model can be found in:

 network will be fully operational for the people in a few days.<br>

 Subject: [gaia] First 3G call from a village in the Amazon forest?
  =20
Hello all

We are happy in the TUCAN3G project today, and I want to share this with=20
you.

Yesterday in Brussels, in a Technical Review of our project in the=20
European Commission, we tested our "low-cost" 3G network that connects=20
some villages in the Amazon forest in a pilot that illustrates the=20
project's results. We had a first 3G phone call to a person in Varadero,=20
a village by the Paranapura river (Amazon forest, Peru), and then a=20
successful skype video session with a nomadic phone in the village.

The system is composed by a MPLS wireless multi-hop backhaul built up=20
with Mikrotik WiFi routers and low-cost 3G outdoor IPaccess femtocells.=20
The carrier is Telefonica, with the traffic being encapsulated in IPSec=20
tunnels accross the rural part to Yurimaguas, where the tunnels continue=20
through Telefonica's core network.

The rural backhaul network does not belong to the operator. It was=20
deployed by IEEE HTC and a local University (PUCP) for use by the rural=20
health facilities and is partially driven by the local government and=20
partly by the communities. They share the bandwidth with the operator=20
for the backhaul. The network will be fully operational for the people=20
in a few days.
